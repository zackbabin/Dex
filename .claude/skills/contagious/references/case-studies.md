# Case Studies: STEPPS Principles in Action

These detailed case study breakdowns illustrate how the STEPPS framework operates in real-world examples. Each case study analyzes what the company or organization did, which STEPPS principles they activated, why it worked from a psychological perspective, and what lessons are transferable to other products and industries.

## Case Study 1: Blendtec "Will It Blend?"

### Background

Blendtec is a manufacturer of commercial and consumer blenders based in Orem, Utah. In 2006, the company had strong commercial sales (restaurant and food service blenders) but struggled in the consumer market. Their blenders were powerful but expensive, and the brand had virtually zero consumer awareness.

Marketing director George Wright discovered that founder Tom Dickson had been testing blenders by blending unusual items — wood boards, marbles — to check durability. Wright realized this was not just a quality assurance process. It was a content goldmine.

### What They Did

They launched a YouTube series called "Will It Blend?" in which Tom Dickson, wearing a lab coat and safety goggles, would blend increasingly extreme objects: golf balls, a rake handle, glow sticks, and most famously, an iPhone. Each video followed an identical format: Tom introduces the object, asks "Will it blend?", blends it, reveals the result, and delivers his catchphrase: "Don't breathe this."

The production budget per video was approximately $50-100 — the cost of the blended item.

### STEPPS Analysis

| Principle | How It Was Activated | Strength |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Social Currency** | "Did you see them blend an iPhone?" made sharers seem plugged-in and entertaining | Strong |
| **Triggers** | Each new viral object (iPhone launches, trending products) became a trigger | Moderate |
| **Emotion** | Amusement (high-arousal positive) from the absurdity of blending an iPad | Very Strong |
| **Public** | YouTube views, embeds, and social shares made it highly visible | Strong |
| **Practical Value** | Implicitly demonstrates extreme blending power ("Imagine what it does to food") | Moderate |
| **Stories** | Perfect Trojan Horse — you cannot retell the story without mentioning Blendtec | Very Strong |

### Why It Worked

**The Trojan Horse was perfect.** Try to tell someone about this series without mentioning Blendtec or "a blender." You can't. The product IS the story. The humor comes from the blender's power. Remove the blender, and there is no story.

**It generated awe-adjacent amusement.** Watching a blender destroy an iPhone is funny, but it's also impressive. The combination of humor and amazement (both high-arousal emotions) created a powerful sharing cocktail.

**It was a series, not a one-off.** The "Will It Blend?" format was infinitely extensible. Each new popular product (iPhone, iPad, Amazon Echo) became a new episode. This created anticipation and a reason to subscribe.

**The cost-to-impact ratio was extraordinary.** Each video cost less than $100 to produce but generated millions of views and measurable sales lift.

### Results

- YouTube channel accumulated hundreds of millions of views
- Consumer sales of Blendtec blenders increased by 700%
- The series ran for over a decade with sustained interest
- Tom Dickson became a recognizable figure, further linking person to brand
- The format was so successful it became a case study in marketing textbooks worldwide

### Transferable Lessons

1. **Demonstrate your core product claim in the most extreme way possible.** What is the most outrageous thing your product can do that proves its core value proposition?
2. **Create a repeatable format.** A series builds audience, anticipation, and a content library. One viral video is a spike; a series is a growth engine.
3. **Make the product the protagonist.** The product should not be the sponsor of the entertainment — it should be the source of the entertainment.
4. **Keep production simple.** The authenticity of a simple setup (one man, one blender, one camera) was part of the charm. Overproduction would have undermined the effect.

## Case Study 2: Barclay Prime's $100 Cheesesteak

### Background

Barclay Prime was a new upscale steakhouse opening in Philadelphia in 2004. Philadelphia is one of the most competitive restaurant markets in the US, and the city is especially proud of its cheesesteak — a working-class sandwich typically costing $5-10. Restaurant owner Howard Wein needed to generate buzz for a new, expensive restaurant with no existing reputation.

### What They Did

Wein created a $100 cheesesteak. Not a $100 steak — a $100 cheesesteak. It was made with Kobe beef, lobster tail, shaved truffles, and marbled cheese, served with a split of Veuve Clicquot champagne. The sandwich was placed on the menu alongside regular (expensive but not outrageous) offerings.

### STEPPS Analysis

| Principle | How It Was Activated | Strength |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Social Currency** | Ordering or knowing about the $100 cheesesteak signals insider status and adventurousness | Very Strong |
| **Triggers** | Every cheesesteak shop in Philadelphia became a trigger for Barclay Prime | Moderate |
| **Emotion** | Surprise and amusement — the audacity of a $100 cheesesteak in Philly | Strong |
| **Public** | People photographed and displayed the cheesesteak; media covered it extensively | Strong |
| **Practical Value** | Low (it's not a "deal") | Weak |
| **Stories** | "I went to this restaurant that has a $100 cheesesteak" is an irresistible story | Very Strong |

### Why It Worked

**Remarkability through extreme contrast.** Philadelphia cheesesteaks cost $5-10. A $100 cheesesteak violates every expectation. The extreme price differential between the norm and the offering creates instant remarkability. It's a "Did you know...?" fact that spreads itself.

**The Trojan Horse was airtight.** You cannot tell someone about the $100 cheesesteak without mentioning Barclay Prime (or at minimum, the restaurant that serves it, which leads to Barclay Prime). The restaurant IS the story.

**Social Currency multiplied.** People who ordered it earned extreme social currency — "I had the $100 cheesesteak at Barclay Prime" is a dinner party story that signals adventurousness, affluence, and insider knowledge. But even people who didn't order it gained social currency from knowing about it.

**Media amplification.** The $100 cheesesteak was covered by every food blogger, local news outlet, and eventually national media. The media earned social currency by covering it (their audiences would find it remarkable), creating a virtuous cycle.

### Results

- Barclay Prime became one of the most talked-about restaurants in Philadelphia from opening day
- The $100 cheesesteak generated millions of dollars in free media coverage
- The restaurant's other (regularly priced) menu items benefited from the foot traffic and reputation
- The concept has been copied by restaurants worldwide (the "loss-leader remarkable item" strategy)

### Transferable Lessons

1. **You don't need to make your entire product remarkable — just one element.** The rest of Barclay Prime's menu was normally priced. The $100 cheesesteak was a single menu item that generated awareness for the whole restaurant.
2. **Violate category expectations.** Take something people think they know (cheesesteaks are cheap) and subvert it dramatically.
3. **The remarkable item doesn't need to be profitable.** The cheesesteak was likely a break-even or loss-leader item. Its value was in word-of-mouth, not direct margin.
4. **Leverage cultural context.** A $100 cheesesteak in Philadelphia — the cheesesteak capital of the world — was far more remarkable than a $100 cheesesteak in any other city.

## Case Study 3: Kit Kat + Coffee Breaks

### Background

By 2007, Kit Kat was a mature brand with declining sales. The candy bar market is intensely competitive, and Kit Kat needed a way to increase consumption without changing the product itself.

### What They Did

Kit Kat repositioned around coffee breaks. The existing tagline "Have a break, have a Kit Kat" was paired systematically with coffee imagery and messaging. Every advertisement, in-store display, and promotional material showed Kit Kat alongside coffee. The association was repeated relentlessly across all channels.

### STEPPS Analysis

| Principle | How It Was Activated | Strength |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Social Currency** | Low — this wasn't about making people look good | Weak |
| **Triggers** | Every coffee break (2-3 times/day for most adults) triggered thoughts of Kit Kat | Very Strong |
| **Emotion** | Moderate — comfort and routine satisfaction | Moderate |
| **Public** | Moderate — seeing someone eating Kit Kat with coffee reinforced the link | Moderate |
| **Practical Value** | Low | Weak |
| **Stories** | Low | Weak |

### Why It Worked

**Frequency is everything.** Coffee breaks happen 2-3 times per day for most working adults. By linking Kit Kat to this daily ritual, the brand went from occasional indulgence to top-of-mind multiple times per day. Each coffee break was a trigger.

**The trigger was already social.** Coffee breaks often involve going to a break room, a coffee shop, or a meeting with colleagues — all social situations where conversation (and therefore word-of-mouth) naturally occurs. The trigger coincided with conversation opportunities.

**The link was plausible.** "Coffee and chocolate" is a natural pairing. The association didn't feel forced. If Kit Kat had tried to link itself to, say, brushing your teeth, the association would have failed because the pairing feels wrong.

### Results

- Kit Kat sales reversed their decline and grew significantly
- The brand solidified its association with coffee breaks in consumer memory
- The strategy has been maintained for years, reinforcing the trigger with each new campaign

### Transferable Lessons

1. **Frequency of trigger beats strength of excitement.** A daily, mundane trigger generates more word-of-mouth than an exciting but rare association.
2. **Link to existing behaviors, don't create new ones.** Kit Kat didn't try to create a new ritual. They attached to an existing one (coffee breaks).
3. **Consistency is critical.** The coffee association was maintained for years across all channels. A trigger link takes time to build and must be reinforced continuously.
4. **Choose triggers that coincide with social moments.** A trigger that occurs during conversation is twice as valuable — it reminds people of the product at the exact moment they can mention it.

## Case Study 4: Livestrong Wristband

### Background

In 2004, Nike and the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the Livestrong Foundation) wanted to raise awareness and funds for cancer research. They needed something that would spread beyond the cycling and cancer communities.

### What They Did

They created a simple yellow silicone wristband, sold for $1. The bright yellow color was distinctive, the material was comfortable for all-day wear, and the price was so low that anyone could participate. The initial goal was to sell 5 million bands.

### STEPPS Analysis

| Principle | How It Was Activated | Strength |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Social Currency** | Wearing the band signaled "I care about cancer research" — positive identity signal | Strong |
| **Triggers** | Seeing the yellow band on anyone's wrist triggered awareness | Strong |
| **Emotion** | Inspiration and hope (high-arousal positive) | Strong |
| **Public** | The wristband was visible on the wrist during all daily activities — maximum observability | Very Strong |
| **Practical Value** | Low (no utility beyond signaling) | Weak |
| **Stories** | Lance Armstrong's cancer survival story was integral | Strong |

### Why It Worked

**Maximum public visibility.** The wristband was visible all day, every day — at work, at the gym, at meals, in conversation. Unlike a donation receipt (private), the wristband turned a private act (donating) into a public signal (wearing).

**Behavioral residue that outlasts the act.** The donation took 10 seconds. The wristband was worn for months or years. Each day of wearing was a day of passive advertising.

**Self-reinforcing visibility loop.** As more people wore the bands, more people noticed them, asked about them, and bought their own. Visibility created demand, which created more visibility.

**Identity signaling without cost.** For $1, anyone could signal "I care about cancer research." The barrier to entry was essentially zero, which maximized adoption.

### Results

- 85 million wristbands sold (17x the original goal)
- Raised $100+ million for cancer research
- Spawned an entire industry of cause-related wristbands (pink for breast cancer, etc.)
- The yellow wristband became a universal symbol of cancer awareness

### Transferable Lessons

1. **Design for wearability.** The wristband succeeded because people wore it all day. Design your "visible artifact" for continuous, comfortable display.
2. **Use a distinctive visual signature.** The bright yellow color stood out against any clothing or background. It was identifiable from across a room.
3. **Minimize the barrier to entry.** At $1, the wristband removed all financial friction. More people participating = more visibility = more adoption.
4. **Pair with a powerful story.** The Livestrong wristband was connected to Lance Armstrong's cancer survival narrative, giving the band emotional weight beyond a simple accessory.

## Case Study 5: Dove "Real Beauty" Campaign

### Background

In 2004, Dove (a Unilever brand) was a commodity soap and personal care brand competing on product features in a crowded market. They needed to differentiate beyond ingredients and price.

### What They Did

Dove launched the "Campaign for Real Beauty," which featured real women (not models) of various body types, ages, and ethnicities in their advertising. The campaign challenged the beauty industry's narrow definitions of beauty, most powerfully through the "Evolution" video (showing a model's transformation through makeup and Photoshop) and the "Real Beauty Sketches" video (showing women described to a forensic sketch artist by themselves vs. by strangers, revealing how harshly women judge their own appearance).

### STEPPS Analysis

| Principle | How It Was Activated | Strength |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Social Currency** | Sharing the campaign signaled progressive values and empathy | Strong |
| **Triggers** | Every beauty ad (from competitors) became a trigger for Dove's counter-message | Moderate |
| **Emotion** | Complex high-arousal blend: anger (at beauty standards), inspiration (real beauty), awe (the sketch reveal) | Very Strong |
| **Public** | Massive media coverage, social sharing, billboards, in-store displays | Strong |
| **Practical Value** | Moderate — provided an empowering perspective on self-image | Moderate |
| **Stories** | The individual women's stories were deeply human and retellable | Very Strong |

### Why It Worked

**Multiple high-arousal emotions simultaneously.** The campaign triggered anger (at unrealistic beauty standards), inspiration (seeing real women celebrated), surprise (the sketch reveal was genuinely shocking), and awe (the emotional power of the realization). This emotional cocktail was extremely high-arousal.

**The story carried the brand.** "Dove did a campaign showing real women instead of models" is a story you can tell in one sentence that carries the brand name. The Trojan Horse worked because Dove's brand was integral to the narrative of challenging beauty norms.

**Competitor advertising became a trigger.** Every time someone saw a traditional beauty ad with airbrushed models, it triggered thoughts of Dove's counter-message. Competitors' own advertising inadvertently promoted Dove's positioning.

**Identity signaling through sharing.** Sharing the Dove campaign signaled "I believe in real beauty" and "I reject unrealistic standards" — both positive identity signals. This social currency drove massive sharing across demographics.

### Results

- "Real Beauty Sketches" became the most-watched ad of all time with 180+ million views
- Dove's sales increased from $2.5 billion to $4 billion in the campaign's first decade
- The campaign has run for 20+ years, continuously evolving
- Spawned industry-wide conversation about beauty standards in advertising

### Transferable Lessons

1. **Challenge industry norms that people already resent.** The backlash against unrealistic beauty standards was simmering. Dove gave it voice and a brand to rally around.
2. **Turn competitor behavior into your trigger.** When competitors do the thing you challenge, they inadvertently promote your message.
3. **Multi-emotion activation amplifies sharing.** The campaign didn't just make people feel one thing — it made them feel many things intensely.
4. **Take a stand.** Commodity products differentiate through values, not features. Dove sold soap by standing for something bigger than soap.

## Case Study 6: Hotmail "Get Your Free Email"

### Background

In 1996, Hotmail was one of the first free web-based email services. Founders Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith needed to grow the user base rapidly with virtually no marketing budget.

### What They Did

They added a simple line at the bottom of every email sent by a Hotmail user: "Get your free email at Hotmail" with a clickable link. Every email sent from a Hotmail account became an advertisement for Hotmail delivered to a non-user.

### STEPPS Analysis

| Principle | How It Was Activated | Strength |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Social Currency** | Early on, having free web-based email was novel and tech-savvy | Moderate |
| **Triggers** | Every email from a Hotmail user was a trigger | Very Strong |
| **Emotion** | Low — functional, not emotional | Weak |
| **Public** | Every email was a public display of Hotmail usage — self-advertising product | Very Strong |
| **Practical Value** | Free email (previously paid) was genuinely valuable | Strong |
| **Stories** | Low | Weak |

### Why It Worked

**The product advertised itself through normal use.** This is the purest form of the Public principle. Hotmail users didn't have to do anything special to promote the product. Just by using email normally, they exposed every recipient to the Hotmail brand and offer.

**Implicit endorsement.** When you receive an email from a friend who uses Hotmail, the friend is implicitly endorsing the product. They chose it and use it. This carried more weight than any advertisement.

**Practical value was clear.** "Free email" in 1996 — when most email required a paid ISP — was immediately, obviously valuable. The value proposition was self-evident.

**Network effects.** As more people joined Hotmail, more emails carried the tagline, exposing more non-users, who then joined and sent more emails. This was a textbook viral loop.

### Results

- Hotmail grew from 0 to 12 million users in 18 months
- Was acquired by Microsoft for $400 million in 1997
- The self-advertising email signature became a template copied by countless companies
- "Sent from my iPhone" is a direct descendant of this strategy

### Transferable Lessons

1. **Make your product self-advertising.** If your product produces output that others see, brand that output.
2. **Make the advertising default, not opt-in.** Users had to actively remove the Hotmail signature. Most didn't bother. Default = maximum exposure.
3. **Embed the value proposition in the advertisement.** "Get your free email" is simultaneously a brand exposure and a clear value proposition. The ad does double duty.
4. **Every user touchpoint with a non-user is a marketing opportunity.** Identify every moment your product touches someone who isn't a user, and make sure it includes a brand signal and value proposition.

## Cross-Case Analysis: What the Best Cases Have in Common

| Pattern | Blendtec | Barclay Prime | Kit Kat | Livestrong | Dove | Hotmail |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| Product IS the story | Yes | Yes | No | Partially | Yes | No |
| Activates 3+ STEPPS | Yes | Yes | No (mainly Triggers) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Low-cost to execute | Yes | Yes | No (major ad spend) | Yes ($1 product) | No (major campaign) | Yes (free) |
| Creates a series/ongoing | Yes | No (single item) | Yes (ongoing campaign) | No (single product) | Yes (ongoing campaign) | Yes (every email) |
| Brand integral to retelling | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Self-reinforcing loop | Yes (more views = more shares) | Yes (more buzz = more diners = more stories) | Yes (more coffee = more Kit Kat thoughts) | Yes (more wristbands = more visibility = more sales) | Yes (more sharing = more awareness = more sales) | Yes (more users = more emails = more users) |

### The Universal Lesson

Every successful case shares one fundamental trait: **the brand cannot be separated from the sharing mechanism.** Whether it's a Trojan Horse story (Blendtec, Barclay Prime), a public signal (Livestrong, Hotmail), a trigger link (Kit Kat), or a values stand (Dove), the brand is structurally embedded in the thing that spreads. This is the difference between content that builds brand and content that just entertains.
