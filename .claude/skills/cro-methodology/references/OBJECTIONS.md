# Objection/Counter-Objection (O/CO) Framework

The core CRE technique for increasing conversions. Don't guess objections—research them. Then systematically counter each one.

## The O/CO Table

Create a two-column table:

| Objection | Counter-Objection |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "It's too expensive" | ROI calculator, payment plans, comparison with alternatives |
| "I don't trust this company" | Testimonials, awards, media mentions, guarantees |
| "It won't work for my situation" | Case studies from similar customers, free trial |

## How to Discover Objections

### Primary Sources (Direct from visitors)

**Exit surveys** (Qualaroo, Hotjar, etc.)
- "What's preventing you from signing up today?"
- "What questions do you still have?"
- "What would make this decision easier?"

**Live chat logs**
- Search for patterns in "but", "however", "worried about"
- Note recurring hesitations

**Support tickets**
- Pre-purchase questions reveal objections
- "Canned responses" are goldmines of tested counter-objections

**Sales call recordings**
- What objections do salespeople hear repeatedly?
- What counter-arguments work?

**"Refer a friend" messages**
- How do customers describe you to friends?
- What do they emphasize? What do they downplay?

### Secondary Sources

**Reviews (yours and competitors')**
- Negative reviews = unaddressed objections
- Positive reviews = effective counter-objections

**Social media mentions**
- Reddit, Twitter threads about your category
- Forums where your audience discusses alternatives

**Competitor analysis**
- What objections do competitors address?
- What proof do they emphasize?

## Types of Objections

### Explicit objections
Easy to address—visitors state them clearly:
- "Too expensive"
- "No free trial"
- "Requires credit card"

### Implicit objections
Harder to identify—visitors won't admit them:
- "I'm lazy and don't want to do the work"
- "I'm not sure I'll follow through"
- "This seems too good to be true"

**Technique for implicit objections**: Use "CO Only" approach—address the objection without stating it.

Bad: "Worried you're too lazy to learn a language?"
Good: "Let the audio do the work for you."

### The "Big 5" Universal Objections

Most products face some version of:

1. **Trust**: "Why should I believe you?"
2. **Price**: "Is it worth the money?"
3. **Fit**: "Will it work for MY situation?"
4. **Timing**: "Why should I act now?"
5. **Effort**: "How hard will this be?"

## Counter-Objection Techniques

### For Trust objections
- Specific testimonials (with photos, names, results)
- Media logos ("As seen in...")
- Awards and certifications
- Team credentials
- Years in business, customers served
- Money-back guarantee

### For Price objections
- ROI calculators
- Cost comparison (vs. alternatives, vs. not solving problem)
- Payment plans
- Price anchoring (show higher-priced option first)
- Emphasize value, not features

### For Fit objections
- Case studies from similar situations
- Segmented landing pages
- "Perfect for [specific audience]" messaging
- FAQ addressing edge cases
- Free trial or sample

### For Timing objections
- Limited-time offers (genuine scarcity only)
- Cost of delay
- Seasonal relevance
- Urgency-building statistics

### For Effort objections
- "Done for you" framing
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Time estimates ("Set up in 5 minutes")
- Onboarding support
- "System" or "process" language

## Placement Strategy

Don't hide objections in FAQ. Address them:

- **At point of friction**: Credit card objection → right below payment form
- **In the flow**: As objections naturally arise during reading
- **Above the fold**: For primary objections
- **Multiple times**: Different formats (text, video, testimonial)

## O/CO Audit Questions

1. What are our visitors' top 5 objections?
2. Which are we NOT addressing on the page?
3. Which are we addressing weakly (no proof)?
4. Are counter-objections placed where objections arise?
5. What counter-objections do competitors use that we don't?
