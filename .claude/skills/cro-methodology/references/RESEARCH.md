# CRO Research Methods & Tools

Don't guess why visitors don't convert. Use these methods to discover the truth.

## Research Framework

### Quantitative (What is happening)
- Analytics data
- Heatmaps
- Click tracking
- Funnel analysis
- A/B test results

### Qualitative (Why it's happening)
- User surveys
- Customer interviews
- Usability testing
- Session recordings
- Support analysis

**Both are essential.** Quantitative shows WHERE problems are. Qualitative shows WHY they exist.

## Analytics Analysis

### Key Reports

**Funnel Visualization**
- Where do visitors drop off?
- Which steps have highest abandonment?
- Do patterns differ by traffic source?

**Landing Page Performance**
- Bounce rate by page
- Time on page
- Exit rate vs. bounce rate

**Traffic Source Analysis**
- Conversion rate by source
- Behavior differences by channel
- Quality vs. quantity of traffic

**Device/Browser Analysis**
- Mobile vs. desktop conversion
- Browser-specific issues
- Page speed by device

### Red Flag Metrics

- Bounce rate > 70% on key pages
- Exit rate spikes at specific steps
- Mobile conversion << desktop (check UX)
- High traffic, low conversion pages
- Long time on checkout pages (confusion)

## User Surveys

### On-Site Surveys (Hotjar, Qualaroo)

**Exit intent surveys**:
- "What stopped you from [action] today?"
- "What's the one thing we could change to make you [action]?"

**Post-purchase surveys**:
- "What almost stopped you from buying?"
- "What convinced you to choose us?"
- "How would you describe [product] to a friend?"

**Browsing surveys** (trigger after X seconds):
- "What brought you here today?"
- "Is there anything you can't find?"

### Email Surveys

**New customers (within 7 days)**:
- "What was your biggest hesitation before buying?"
- "What finally convinced you?"
- "What's one thing we could improve?"

**Non-converters (abandoned cart)**:
- "We noticed you didn't complete your order. What stopped you?"
- Keep it to ONE question for higher response rates

### Survey Best Practices

1. Ask ONE question (max 2-3)
2. Open-ended > multiple choice for discovery
3. Time triggers thoughtfully
4. Don't annoy—limit frequency
5. Incentivize for longer surveys

## Usability Testing

### DIY Testing (5-10 users is enough)

**Tasks to test**:
1. Find [specific product/information]
2. Complete [primary action]
3. Understand [value proposition]
4. Compare [options/plans]

**What to observe**:
- Where do users hesitate?
- What do they say aloud?
- What do they click expecting something different?
- What frustrates them?

### 5-Second Test

Show page for 5 seconds, then ask:
- "What is this page about?"
- "What action should you take?"
- "What company is this?"

Tests clarity of value proposition and hierarchy.

### First-Click Testing

Give users a task, record where they click first:
- Is it the right element?
- Do different user types behave differently?

## Session Recordings (Hotjar, FullStory)

### What to Look For

**Rage clicks**: Rapid clicking = frustration
**Dead clicks**: Clicking non-clickable elements
**U-turns**: Going back immediately
**Form abandonment**: Which fields cause drop-off
**Scroll depth**: How far do visitors read?

### Prioritization

Focus on recordings from:
- High-value pages
- High drop-off points
- Specific user segments (buyers vs. non-buyers)

## Heatmaps

### Click Heatmaps
- What gets clicked (and what doesn't)?
- Are CTAs getting attention?
- Are non-clickable elements being clicked?

### Scroll Heatmaps
- How far do visitors scroll?
- What percentage see key content?
- Where do visitors stop reading?

### Move Heatmaps
- Where does attention focus?
- What gets ignored?

### Heatmap Insights → Actions

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| CTA not clicked | Test position, color, copy |
| Important content below fold | Move up or add anchor |
| Non-clickable element clicked | Make it clickable or remove |
| Users stop scrolling early | Improve above-fold content |

## Competitive Analysis

### What to Analyze

- Value propositions
- Pricing/positioning
- Social proof used
- Objections addressed
- Risk reversal offers
- Onboarding flows
- Email sequences (sign up!)

### Competitive O/CO Mining

1. Read competitor reviews (positive and negative)
2. Note objections customers raise
3. Note what competitors claim as strengths
4. Identify gaps in their approach

## Customer Interview Guide

### Who to Interview

- Recent buyers (why they bought)
- Recent non-buyers (why they didn't)
- Long-term customers (what keeps them)
- Churned customers (why they left)

### Key Questions

**Pre-purchase**:
- "What triggered you to look for a solution?"
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "What almost stopped you from buying?"
- "What convinced you to choose us?"

**Post-purchase**:
- "What result have you achieved?"
- "What's been harder than expected?"
- "What would you tell a friend about us?"

### Interview Tips

1. Let them talk (don't lead)
2. Ask "why" repeatedly (5 Whys)
3. Get specific examples
4. Record for quotes (with permission)
5. Look for patterns across interviews

## Research Prioritization

1. Start with analytics (quick, free)
2. Add on-site survey (1 question)
3. Review existing support/chat logs
4. Watch 10-20 session recordings
5. Run 5 usability tests
6. Deep-dive interviews (ongoing)
