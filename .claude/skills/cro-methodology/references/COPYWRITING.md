# Persuasive Copywriting for CRO

Evidence-based copywriting principles. Write as much as it takes to communicate your entire sales message—but not one word more.

## Headlines

The headline's job: Get visitors to read the next line.

### Headline Formulas That Work

**Problem-agitate-solve**:
"Tired of [problem]? [Solution] lets you [benefit]."

**Specificity wins**:
Bad: "Improve your conversion rate"
Good: "How we increased conversions by 363%"

**News angle**:
"[X] facts about [topic] you were never told"

**How-to**:
"How to [achieve result] without [common pain]"

**Question**:
"What's stopping your website from converting?"

### Headline Testing Priority

1. Value proposition clarity
2. Specific numbers/results
3. Audience targeting
4. Urgency/timeliness
5. Emotional hook

## Body Copy Principles

### Length
Write as much as it takes to:
- Communicate the complete sales message
- Address all major objections
- Provide sufficient proof

Long copy works when visitors are:
- Unfamiliar with product category
- Making a high-commitment decision
- Comparing alternatives

Short copy works when:
- Brand is well-known
- Product is simple/commoditized
- Visitors are already convinced

### Structure

**Lead with benefits, not features**
Feature: "256GB storage"
Benefit: "Never delete another photo"

**Use specific numbers**
Weak: "Thousands of customers"
Strong: "47,832 businesses trust us"

**Write for scanners**
- Subheadings that tell the story alone
- Bold key phrases
- Bullet points for multiple items
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)

### Voice

**Clarity over cleverness**
No reader is too sophisticated for simple sentences.

**Active voice**
Bad: "Your conversion rate will be improved"
Good: "We'll improve your conversion rate"

**"You" focus**
Count "you" vs. "we" in your copy. Visitors care about themselves.

**Circle adjectives and adverbs**
Replace vague modifiers with specific facts:
Bad: "incredibly fast delivery"
Good: "delivery in 2 hours or less"

## Proof Elements

### Hierarchy of proof (strongest to weakest)

1. **Specific results with context**
   "Increased revenue by $2.4M in 6 months"

2. **Named testimonials with photos**
   Real people, real companies, specific outcomes

3. **Case studies**
   Problem → Solution → Results format

4. **Statistics and data**
   Industry benchmarks, research findings

5. **Logos and badges**
   Client logos, media mentions, certifications

6. **Generic testimonials**
   Unnamed quotes (weakest form)

### Testimonial Best Practices

**Include specifics**:
Bad: "Great product!"
Good: "Increased our conversion rate from 2.1% to 4.7% in 3 weeks"

**Address objections**:
Choose testimonials that counter specific fears

**Match the audience**:
B2B visitors want testimonials from similar companies/roles

**Use photos**:
Real photos > stock photos > no photos

## Calls-to-Action

### CTA Copy

**Benefit-oriented**:
Bad: "Submit"
Good: "Get my free report"

**Reduce perceived commitment**:
"Start free trial" vs. "Sign up"
"See pricing" vs. "Buy now"

**Match button to promise**:
If page promises "10 ways to improve X", CTA should be:
"Show me the 10 ways" not "Learn more"

### CTA Placement

- Above the fold (for aware visitors)
- After each major section
- At moment of peak interest
- Sticky/floating for long pages

### CTA Testing Ideas

1. Benefit vs. action language
2. Commitment level (free vs. buy)
3. Urgency elements
4. Size and color (test AFTER copy)
5. Number of CTAs per page

## Common Copywriting Mistakes

1. **Features without benefits**
   Always answer "So what?"

2. **Vague claims**
   "Best in class" → "Rated #1 by [source]"

3. **Talking about yourself**
   Reframe everything around the visitor

4. **Burying the lead**
   Put most important information first

5. **Assuming knowledge**
   Explain industry jargon

6. **Missing objections**
   Address hesitations head-on

7. **Weak proof**
   Generic testimonials, no specifics

8. **Unclear next step**
   Always make the action obvious
