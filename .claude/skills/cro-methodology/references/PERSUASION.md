- Testimonials at decision points
- Expert endorsements

### Authority
- Expert positioning
- Media logos
- Certifications visible
- Specific credentials

### Reciprocity
- Free valuable content upfront
- Free tools/calculators
- Generous trial periods
- Helpful support

### Commitment/Consistency
- Micro-commitments (email before credit card)
- Progress indicators
- "You're almost there" messaging
- Previous choices displayed

### Loss Aversion
- Cost of inaction
- "What you're missing"
- Comparison with competitors' customers
- Before/after contrast

## The "Proof Sandwich"

Structure for maximum persuasion:

1. **Claim**: Make a bold, specific promise
2. **Proof**: Immediately support with evidence
3. **Reinforcement**: Add secondary proof

Example:
"We increase conversion rates by an average of 47%" (claim)
"Here's how we did it for Company X..." (proof)
"And here's what their CEO says about working with us..." (reinforcement)

## Placement Principles

### Above the fold
- Main value proposition
- Primary social proof (logo bar, rating)
- Clear CTA

### Throughout the page
- Testimonials at objection points
- Data supporting each claim
- Visual proof (screenshots, photos)

### Decision points
- Guarantees near payment
- Trust badges near forms
- Testimonials near CTAs

### Bottom of page
- Comprehensive FAQ
- Trust indicators
- Alternative contact options

## Asset Display Best Practices

### Logo bars
- 5-7 recognizable logos
- Similar visual treatment
- Relevant to target audience

### Testimonials
- Photo + Name + Company + Title
- Specific results > vague praise
- Match testimonial to objection

### Statistics
- Round numbers seem less credible
- "47,832 customers" > "About 50,000"
- Source your data

### Guarantees
- Make them prominent, not hidden
- Explain what happens if claimed
- Reduce perceived risk of claiming
