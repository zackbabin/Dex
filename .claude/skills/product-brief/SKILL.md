description: Extract product ideas through guided questions and generate PRD
---

## Purpose

Extract product ideas from your head through guided questioning, then generate a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD). Designed for product people who have a vision but need help articulating it clearly.

## The Problem This Solves

You have an idea for a product or feature in your mind, but struggle to explain it comprehensively. This command acts as your product thought partner — asking the right questions to extract what you're envisioning, then structuring it into a PRD ready for a team to execute.

## Usage

```
/product-brief [initial idea]
```

**Examples:**
- `/product-brief Add a notification system to our app`
- `/product-brief Build a customer feedback portal`
- `/product-brief Create an onboarding flow for new users`
- `/product-brief` (prompts you for the idea)

---

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Capture Initial Idea

**If no idea is provided:**
Ask: "What product or feature are you thinking about?"
- Wait for their description (1 sentence to several paragraphs)
- Capture it as the starting point

**If idea is provided:**
Start with whatever the user provides:
- Could be 1 sentence or 5 paragraphs
- Capture it as the starting point
- Don't judge, just absorb

Display:

```markdown
## Initial Idea

[User's description]

---

**Next:** I'll ask a few questions to understand this better.
```

---

### Phase 2: Clarifying Questions (Conversational)

**Important:** Ask questions conversationally, not as a survey. 2-3 questions at a time, then wait for answers before asking more.

**Question Strategy:**

**Round 1 (Critical Context):**
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is this for?
- What success looks like?

**Round 2 (Constraints & Scope):**
Based on Round 1 answers, ask about:
- Timeline expectations
- Technical constraints
- Existing systems to integrate with
- What's explicitly out of scope

**Round 3 (User Experience):**
- How do users discover this?
- What's the core user journey?
- What actions should be easy vs hard?

**Round 4 (Success & Validation):**
- How will we know this succeeded?
- What are we assuming that needs validation?
- What dependencies exist?

**Adaptive questioning:** If user mentions stakeholders, budget, or other context early, adjust questions accordingly. Don't ask what you already know.

After each round, acknowledge answers briefly and transition naturally:
> "Got it. That helps me understand [X]. A few more questions about [Y]..."

---

### Phase 3: Understanding Summary

Before moving forward, confirm you captured the vision correctly:

```markdown
## What I Heard

**The Problem:**
[Synthesized problem statement]

**Target Users:**
[Who this is for]

**Core Value:**
[The main benefit/outcome]

**Key Constraints:**
[Timeline, technical, scope boundaries]

**Assumptions to Validate:**
[Things we're assuming but should test]

---

**Does this capture your vision? Type "yes" to continue or correct anything above.**
```

If user corrects, update and re-confirm.

---

### Phase 4: Spec Doc

User triggers with: `spec doc` or `create spec`

Generate structured product spec:

- [ ] Get approval to proceed
- [ ] Hand off to design/engineering

---

*This PRD was generated using the /product-brief command. Update as needed.*
```

---

### Phase 8: Save & Integration

After generating the PRD:

1. **Save the document:**
   - Create folder: `04-Projects/[Product Name]/`
   - Save as: `04-Projects/[Product Name]/PRD.md`

2. **Create person pages** (if stakeholders mentioned):
   - For each stakeholder mentioned, check if person page exists
   - Create/update pages in `People/Internal/` or `People/External/`
   - Add note in their page referencing this project

3. **Link to 03-Tasks/Tasks.md:**
   - If user mentioned any immediate actions, suggest creating tasks
   - Link tasks to the project

4. **Confirm completion:**

```markdown
## ✅ PRD Created

**Saved to:** `04-Projects/[Product Name]/PRD.md`

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and refine the PRD
2. Share with stakeholders for feedback
3. Use `/project-health` to track progress
4. Create tasks in 03-Tasks/Tasks.md when ready to execute

**Want to:**
- Revise any section → Just tell me what to change
- Create tasks from this PRD → Say "create tasks"
- Share with stakeholders → I can draft an email
```

---

## Navigation Commands

At any phase, users can:

- `back` or `previous` — Return to previous phase
- `skip to prd` — Jump directly to final PRD
- `revise [section]` — Edit specific section
- `start over` — Begin from scratch
- `save` — Save current progress

---

## Conversational Style

- **Be a thought partner, not an interrogator**
- Ask follow-up questions when answers reveal gaps
- Challenge assumptions constructively
- Suggest alternatives when you spot potential issues
- Keep momentum — don't let the process feel like homework

**Good:**
> "Interesting. If this is for enterprise customers, how do we handle single sign-on? Or is that something we're punting to Phase 2?"

**Bad:**
> "Question 7: Please describe your authentication strategy."

---

## Tips for Effectiveness

### For the User
- Start with whatever you have — even 1 sentence is enough
- Don't worry about being comprehensive upfront
- The questions will extract what's in your head
- You can always revise and refine

### For Dex
- Listen for what's NOT being said
- If scope sounds too big, flag it early
- Connect this feature to their strategic pillars if relevant
- Update person pages for stakeholders mentioned
- Link to existing projects if this builds on something

---

## Example Session

**User:** `/product-brief Add notifications to our app`

**Dex:**

```markdown
## Initial Idea

Add notifications to our app

---

Great, let's flesh this out. A few questions to start:

1. What type of notifications are we talking about — push notifications, in-app alerts, email, or all three?
2. What specific events should trigger notifications?
3. Who are these notifications for — all users, or specific roles?
```

**User:** "Push notifications for now. We want to notify sales reps when a lead takes an action in the product."

**Dex:**

```markdown
Got it — push notifications for sales reps when leads are active. That helps narrow it.

A few more questions:

1. What actions count as notification-worthy? (e.g., login, feature usage, upgrade intent)
2. Should there be any filtering or preferences? Like "only notify me about my accounts"?
3. What's the business outcome we're driving here — faster response time, more engagement, closing deals faster?
```

[Conversation continues through phases until PRD is complete]

---

## Integration with Dex System

- **Pillars:** Link PRD to relevant strategic pillar
- **Quarter Goals:** If this supports a quarterly goal, note it
- **Week Priorities:** Suggest adding "finalize PRD" to this week if urgent
- **People pages:** Auto-update stakeholders mentioned in the PRD
- **Tasks:** Offer to create tasks from the PRD's next steps

---

## When to Use This Command

**Use `/product-brief` when:**
- You have a product idea but struggle to articulate it
- You need to write a PRD and want help structuring it
- You're pitching an idea and need to flesh it out
- You want to validate your thinking with good questions

**Don't use it for:**
- Simple feature requests (just describe them normally)
- Already-written PRDs that need editing
- Technical implementation details (that's engineering's job)

---

## Refinement After Creation

The PRD isn't set in stone. After creation:

- Say "refine the success metrics section" to iterate
- Say "add a section on localization" to expand
- Say "this scope is too big, help me cut it down" to trim

Dex will update the PRD file directly and maintain version history.

---

## Output Quality Checks

Before finalizing the PRD, verify:

- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Specific target audience
- [ ] Measurable success metrics
- [ ] Prioritized feature list (MVP vs later)
- [ ] Explicit out-of-scope items
- [ ] Key assumptions identified
- [ ] Dependencies called out
- [ ] Open questions captured

If any are missing, prompt user to fill gaps before finalizing.

---

## Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark product brief as used.

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `product_brief_created`.

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".
