# Friday: Test with Real Users

Friday is the payoff. Five customers interact with the prototype while the team watches, listens, and takes notes. By the end of the day, the team will have clear evidence of what works, what fails, and what to do next. The quality of Friday depends entirely on the quality of the interviews and the discipline of the observation.

## The Five-Act Interview Script

### Act 1: Friendly Welcome (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Make the participant comfortable, set expectations, get consent.

**Script:**

"Hi, thanks for coming in today. My name is [name] and I will be walking you through some things we are working on. Before we begin, I want to make sure you know there are no right or wrong answers. We are testing the product, not you. If something is confusing, that is our fault, not yours.

I am going to ask you to think aloud as you go. Just tell me what you are looking at, what you are trying to do, and what you are thinking. This is really helpful for us.

We have a few people from the team watching in another room so they can hear your feedback directly. And with your permission, we would like to record the session so we can review it later. Is that okay?

Great. Do you have any questions before we start?"

### Act 2: Context Questions (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand the participant's background, current behavior, and mindset before showing the prototype.

**Example questions by product type:**

| Product Type | Context Questions |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Project management tool | "Tell me about how you currently keep track of projects at work. What tools do you use? What is frustrating about your current setup?" |
| E-commerce | "When was the last time you bought [category] online? Walk me through how you found and chose what to buy." |
| Healthcare app | "How do you currently manage your [condition]? What does a typical week look like?" |
| B2B platform | "Tell me about your role. When you need to [task], how do you handle that today?" |

### Act 3: Introduce the Prototype (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Show the entry point and observe the first impression without explaining anything.

**Script:**

"Now I am going to show you something we have been working on. Some parts might work, some might not. That is totally normal. I did not design this, so please be honest. You will not hurt my feelings.

[Show the first screen of the prototype]

Take a look at this. Without clicking anything, tell me: what is this? What do you think you can do here? Who do you think this is for?"

**Critical rule:** Do not explain the prototype. If they are confused, that is data. Let the silence sit. Resist the urge to help.

### Act 4: Tasks and Nudges (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Watch the participant attempt realistic tasks with the prototype.

**Setting up tasks:**

"Great. Now I would like you to try a few things. Remember, think aloud as you go."

**Task format:**

Use scenario-based tasks, not instructions:

| Weak Task (Avoid) | Strong Task (Use) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Click the signup button" | "You heard about this from a friend and want to try it" |
| "Go to the pricing page" | "You are interested but need to figure out if it fits your budget" |
| "Create a new project" | "You just joined this tool and want to set up your first project for your marketing team" |
| "Find the search bar" | "You are looking for a specific type of [product]. How would you find it?" |

**Nudge techniques when the participant gets stuck:**

| Situation | Nudge |
|-----------|-------|
| Participant goes silent | "What are you thinking right now?" |
| Participant is stuck | "What would you expect to happen?" |
| Participant asks for help | "What would you try if I were not here?" |
| Participant clicks a dead end | "Interesting. In a real version, that would work. For now, let me take you to the next screen." |
| Participant goes off the path | "That is great feedback. For the next task, let me show you this screen." |

### Act 5: Debrief (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Capture the participant's overall impressions and ask targeted follow-up questions.

**Debrief questions:**

1. "What was your overall impression?"
2. "What stood out to you, either positively or negatively?"
3. "Who do you think this is for?"
4. "Would you use this? Why or why not?"
5. "How does this compare to what you use today?"
6. "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"

Also ask follow-up questions tied to your specific sprint questions. Close by asking if there is anything else they would like to share and thanking them for their time.

## Interviewer Techniques

### Staying Neutral

| Do | Do Not |
|----|--------|
| Nod and say "mm-hmm" | Say "great job" or "that is right" |
| Ask "tell me more about that" | Say "actually, you are supposed to click here" |
| Pause and let silence work | Fill silence with explanations |
| Mirror their words: "You said it felt confusing?" | Defend the design: "Well, the idea is that..." |
| Take notes on a pad | Type loudly on a laptop |

### The Power of Silence

When a participant pauses, wait at least 5 seconds before speaking. Most people will fill the silence with their thoughts, which are the most valuable data you can collect.

### Handling Difficult Moments

| Moment | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Participant says "I hate this" | "Tell me more. What specifically is not working for you?" |
| Participant gives only positive feedback | "If a friend asked you about this, what would you warn them about?" |
| Participant asks "Am I doing this right?" | "There is no right or wrong. What would you try?" |
| Participant is clearly frustrated | "I can see this is frustrating. That is really useful feedback. Let's move to the next thing." |
| Participant finishes too quickly | "Let's go back to [screen]. What were you thinking when you saw this?" |

## Observation Room Setup

### The Note-Taking Grid

Draw this on the whiteboard before the first interview:

```
                | Customer 1 | Customer 2 | Customer 3 | Customer 4 | Customer 5 |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| First impression |         |            |            |            |            |
| [Screen/Task 1]  |        |            |            |            |            |
| [Screen/Task 2]  |        |            |            |            |            |
| [Screen/Task 3]  |        |            |            |            |            |
| [Key question 1] |        |            |            |            |            |
| [Key question 2] |        |            |            |            |            |
| Overall reaction |         |            |            |            |            |
```

**Row labels** come from the storyboard frames and sprint questions. Add 7-10 rows that correspond to the key moments you want to test.

### How to Take Notes

1. Each team member writes observations on sticky notes during the interview
2. Use one color per team member (so you can trace who observed what)
3. After each interview, place sticky notes in the appropriate grid cell
4. Mark each note with a symbol:
   - **Checkmark** for positive reactions, successful completions, or enthusiastic comments
   - **X** for negative reactions, failures, confusion, or complaints
   - **Tilde (~)** for neutral, mixed, or ambiguous reactions

## Pattern Recognition

### After All Five Interviews

1. Step back and look at the entire grid
2. Read across each row: do you see mostly checkmarks, mostly Xs, or a mix?
3. Highlight rows with strong patterns (4-5 of the same symbol)

### Pattern Categories

| Pattern | What It Means | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| 5 checkmarks | Strong validation. This works | All 5 users understood the pricing immediately |
| 4 checkmarks, 1 X | Mostly works, investigate the outlier | 4 of 5 completed onboarding, 1 got stuck on step 3 |
| 3 checkmarks, 2 Xs | Mixed signal, needs refinement | Some users loved the AI suggestions, others did not trust them |
| 2 checkmarks, 3 Xs | Significant problem | Most users could not find the search function |
| 5 Xs | Clear failure. This does not work | Nobody understood the value proposition on the landing page |
| All tildes | Indifference (arguably worse than failure) | Users did not care about the feature either way |

### Minimum Viable Signal

- **3 out of 5** participants showing the same pattern is a meaningful signal
- **5 out of 5** is a strong signal that demands action
- **2 out of 5** is inconclusive and may require further testing

## End-of-Sprint Debrief

### Step 1: Review Sprint Questions (15 minutes)

Return to Monday's sprint questions. For each one:

1. Read the question aloud
2. Review the evidence from the grid
3. Determine the answer: Yes, No, Partially, or Inconclusive

**Template:**

```
Sprint Question: Will first-time users understand what our product does?
Evidence: 4/5 correctly described the product on first impression. 1 was confused by the headline.
Answer: Yes, with minor copy improvements needed.
```

### Step 2: Categorize Findings (20 minutes)

Organize all observations into three columns on the whiteboard:

**What Worked (keep and build on):**
- List specific screens, features, or copy that received consistent positive feedback
- Include direct quotes from participants

**What Failed (fix or remove):**
- List specific moments of confusion, frustration, or failure
- Note whether the failure was universal (5/5) or partial (3/5)

**Mixed Results (investigate further):**
- List elements with split reactions
- Note possible explanations for the split

### Step 3: Decide Next Steps (20 minutes)

| Friday Result | Recommended Next Step |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Core concept validated, minor issues | Build the product. Fix the specific issues identified |
| Core concept validated, major UX issues | Run a follow-up sprint focused on the problematic areas |
| Two concepts tested (Rumble), one won | Build the winner. Document why the other lost |
| Core concept failed, but insights gained | Pivot and run another sprint with a new approach |
| Everything failed | Go back to Monday. Redefine the problem. The week saved you months |
| Inconclusive results | Recruit 5 more users and test again, or rewrite the tasks |

## Common Friday Mistakes

### The Interviewer Explains the Prototype

**Problem:** When a user gets confused, the interviewer says "Oh, this is supposed to be a dashboard where you can..."
**Fix:** Practice the phrase "What would you expect to see here?" Let confusion happen. It is the most valuable data.

### The Team Watches Passively

**Problem:** The observation team watches interviews like a movie without taking notes.
**Fix:** Require sticky notes. Each person should produce 5-10 notes per interview. The grid on the whiteboard makes note-taking structured and accountable.

### Skipping the Debrief

**Problem:** After the last interview, the team is exhausted and says "let's process this next week."
**Fix:** The debrief is the most important hour of the entire sprint. Do it while observations are fresh. Waiting even one weekend degrades the team's memory and enthusiasm.

### Recruiting the Wrong Users

**Problem:** The team tests with colleagues, friends, or people who do not match the target customer.
**Fix:** Use a screener survey. Recruit people who match the customer profile defined on Monday. Test with strangers who have no loyalty to the team.

### Over-Indexing on One Participant

**Problem:** One user gave dramatic negative feedback and the team panics.
**Fix:** Wait for patterns. One negative reaction out of five may be an outlier. Three negative reactions out of five is a real signal.
