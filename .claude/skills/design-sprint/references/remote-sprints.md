# Remote Design Sprints

Running a design sprint with a distributed team requires deliberate adaptation of every exercise. The core principles remain the same: time-box, work individually, let the Decider decide, prototype, and test. But the tools, energy management, and communication patterns must change to account for screen fatigue, time zones, and the absence of a shared physical space.

## Tool Stack

### Essential Tools

| Purpose | Recommended Tool | Why |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Digital whiteboard | Miro or FigJam | Replaces physical whiteboards for mapping, HMWs, voting |
| Video conferencing | Zoom or Google Meet | Screen sharing, breakout rooms, recording |
| Prototyping | Figma | Real-time collaboration, easy sharing for testing |
| Async video | Loom | Lightning Demos, expert interviews that can be watched asynchronously |
| Chat | Slack or Teams | Side channel for logistics, questions, and sharing links |
| Timer | Cuckoo.team or Toggl Timer | Shared visible timer that all participants see |
| File sharing | Google Drive or Notion | Central place for templates, assets, and outputs |

### Miro/FigJam Board Setup

Create a single board for the entire sprint with clearly labeled sections:

```
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|     MONDAY        |     TUESDAY       |    WEDNESDAY      |
| - Long-term goal  | - Lightning Demos | - Art Museum      |
| - Sprint questions| - Sketch uploads  | - Heat map        |
| - Customer map    |                   | - Straw poll      |
| - HMW notes       |                   | - Storyboard      |
| - Target          |                   |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|     THURSDAY      |      FRIDAY       |     PARKING LOT   |
| - Prototype link  | - Note-taking     | - Unresolved      |
| - Interview script|   grid            |   questions       |
| - Trial run notes | - Patterns        | - Future ideas    |
|                   | - Next steps      |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
```

Pre-populate each section with templates, instructions, and placeholder sticky notes before the sprint begins.

## Time Zone Considerations

### Single Time Zone (All Participants Within 2 Hours)

Run the sprint at normal hours for the majority. Adjust start/end times by 30-60 minutes to accommodate the edges.

### Two Time Zones (3-6 Hours Apart)

| Approach | Schedule |
|----------|----------|
| Overlap window | Find the 4-5 hour window where both zones are in working hours. Run all synchronous exercises during this window |
| Extended async | Use 2-3 hours of sync time per day and shift more exercises to async |

**Example: New York (EST) + London (GMT), 5-hour difference:**

| Time (EST) | Time (GMT) | Activity |
|------------|------------|----------|
| 8:00 AM | 1:00 PM | Sync block begins |
| 8:00 - 8:30 | 1:00 - 1:30 | Recap and framing |
| 8:30 - 11:30 | 1:30 - 4:30 | Core exercises (sync) |
| 11:30 - 12:00 | 4:30 - 5:00 | Wrap-up and async assignments |
| 12:00 - 2:00 | 5:00+ (done) | US team does async work |

### Three or More Time Zones (7+ Hours Apart)

A fully synchronous 5-day sprint is impractical. Use compressed schedules (see below), heavy async with short sync check-ins, or extend the sprint across 7-8 calendar days.

## Adapting Each Day for Remote

### Remote Monday: Map

**Sync exercises:**
- Long-term goal (30 min, video call, everyone writes in Miro simultaneously)
- Sprint questions (30 min, same format)
- Customer journey map (45 min, Sprint Master draws in Miro while team directs)

**Async exercises:**
- Expert interviews can be pre-recorded on Loom (10-15 min each, team watches on their own time)
- HMW notes: each person adds sticky notes to the Miro board asynchronously after watching expert videos

**Sync decision:**
- HMW voting (15 min, use Miro's built-in voting feature)
- Target selection with Decider (15 min, video call)

### Remote Tuesday: Sketch

**Sync exercises:**
- Lightning Demos (45 min, each person shares screen for 3 minutes)

**Async exercises:**
- Notes phase (20 min, everyone reviews the Miro board on their own)
- Ideas phase (20 min, individual work)
- Crazy 8s (8 min, individual work, upload photos of paper sketches)
- Solution Sketch (60-90 min, individual work)

**How to handle sketches remotely:**
1. Sketch on paper with a thick marker (same as in-person)
2. Photograph each panel with a phone
3. Upload to the designated Miro area by a set deadline
4. Each sketch gets its own frame in Miro, numbered and anonymous

Set a firm deadline for sketch uploads. The Sprint Master confirms receipt of all sketches. No one views others' sketches until Wednesday.

### Remote Wednesday: Decide

**Sync exercises (these must be synchronous):**
- Art Museum: everyone silently reviews sketches in Miro, placing dot stickers (20 min)
- Speed Critique: Sprint Master shares screen and narrates each sketch (3 min per sketch)
- Straw Poll: everyone places their vote simultaneously in Miro (5 min)
- Supervote: Decider places their votes (5 min)

**Async/sync exercises:**
- Storyboard: can be done with the Sprint Master building in Miro while the team provides direction on a video call, or the Sprint Master can draft it async and get sync approval

**Remote Wednesday tips:**
- The Art Museum works surprisingly well in Miro: participants browse and place dots silently
- During Speed Critique, the Sprint Master must share screen and control the zoom/navigation
- Use a different color dot for each participant to track who voted for what
- The Decider should be present for the entire sync session

### Remote Thursday: Prototype

**Sync exercises:**
- Morning kick-off: assign roles and divide storyboard (30 min)
- Mid-day check-in (15 min)
- End-of-day review: walk through prototype together (30 min)
- Trial run (30 min)

**Async work:**
- Building the prototype (individual or paired work in Figma)
- Writing copy (Writer works independently, shares in Slack)
- Gathering assets (Collector works independently)
- Writing the interview script (Interviewer works independently)

**Remote Thursday tips:**
- Figma's real-time collaboration makes remote prototyping nearly as efficient as in-person
- The Stitcher should set up the Figma file structure before the morning kick-off
- Use a shared Slack channel for quick questions and asset sharing
- The Sprint Master should check in every 90 minutes via a quick standup message

### Remote Friday: Test

**Interview options:**
- Video call interview (Zoom, Google Meet) with the participant sharing their screen
- Unmoderated testing platform (UserTesting.com, Maze) for asynchronous feedback
- Moderated video call is strongly preferred for design sprints

**Observation setup:**
- All observers join a separate "observation" Zoom call
- The Interviewer conducts the interview on the main call
- Screen share from the Interviewer's call is piped to the observation call
- Observers take notes in the shared Miro grid (same format as in-person)
- Use a shared chat channel for observers to flag interesting moments in real time

**Remote Friday tips:**
- Test the video/audio setup 24 hours before the first interview
- Send participants a test link to verify their screen sharing works
- Have a backup plan if a participant cannot share their screen (the Interviewer controls the prototype and asks the participant to direct them)
- Between interviews, do a quick 5-minute debrief on the observation call

## Compressed Schedule Options

### 4-Day Sprint

Combine Monday and Tuesday into a single day by compressing exercises and using async pre-work.

| Day | Activities |
|-----|-----------|
| Pre-work (async) | Expert interviews via Loom, Lightning Demos recorded and shared |
| Day 1 (Mon) | Long-term goal, sprint questions, map, HMW, target + Notes, Ideas, Crazy 8s, Solution Sketch |
| Day 2 (Tue) | Art Museum, Speed Critique, Voting, Storyboard |
| Day 3 (Wed) | Prototype |
| Day 4 (Thu) | Test and debrief |

**4-day sprint trade-offs:**
- Day 1 is very long and intense (8-9 hours of focused work)
- Less time for expert interviews (use async pre-recorded format)
- Solution sketches have less incubation time
- Works best for experienced sprint teams

### 3-Day Sprint

Requires significant async pre-work (expert interviews, Lightning Demos, goal/questions drafts done 1 week before). Day 1 covers finalize/map/sketch/decide. Day 2 is prototyping. Day 3 is testing and debrief. Works for focused problems where the team has deep context. Not recommended for first-time sprints.

## Remote-Specific Exercise Adaptations

### Dot Voting in Miro

1. Create a "voting" frame in the Miro board
2. Give each participant a set number of colored dots (use Miro's sticker feature or small circles)
3. Set a timer (visible to all via the shared timer)
4. Lock the board after voting to prevent late changes
5. Use Miro's "hide cursors" feature during voting to prevent following behavior

### Crazy 8s: Remote Version

Sketch on paper with a thick marker (same as in-person), photograph each panel, and upload to the designated Miro area. The Sprint Master counts down each minute on the video call. Paper and photograph is strongly preferred over digital sketching in Miro because the physical act of folding and drawing creates energy that digital tools cannot replicate.

### Storyboard: Remote Version

The Sprint Master builds the storyboard in Miro while the team provides direction over video call. The Sprint Master shares their screen, draws each frame based on team input, and controls the final layout. Alternatively, assign one person to draft the storyboard async and review sync the next morning.

## Energy Management for Remote Participants

### Screen Fatigue Is Real

Remote sprints are more exhausting than in-person sprints because video calls require more cognitive effort than face-to-face conversation. Plan for it.

### Remote Energy Tactics

| Tactic | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| Camera breaks | Turn cameras off during individual work, on during group work |
| Shorter sync blocks | Max 90 minutes of sync time before a break |
| Physical movement | 5-minute stretch break every 60 minutes |
| Async work blocks | Alternate between sync discussion and async individual work |
| Music during silent work | Sprint Master plays music via screen share or shares a playlist link |
| Chat engagement | Use emoji reactions in chat to maintain energy without interrupting |

### Daily Structure for Remote Energy

```
Sync block 1 (90 min) → Break (15 min) → Async work (60 min) →
Sync block 2 (60 min) → Lunch (60 min) → Async work (90 min) →
Sync block 3 (60 min) → Break (15 min) → Wrap-up sync (15 min)
```

This structure limits total sync time to approximately 3.5 hours per day while maintaining 6-7 hours of productive sprint work.

## Async vs Sync Quick Reference

**Must be sync:** Long-term goal discussion, customer journey map, all voting (HMW, Art Museum, straw poll, supervote), speed critique, user interviews, debrief.

**Can be async:** Expert interviews (Loom), HMW note writing, four-step sketch, prototype building, asset gathering, copy writing.

**Either way:** Lightning Demos (sync is more energetic, async Loom works for time zone conflicts), storyboard (Sprint Master can draft async, team reviews sync).

## Remote Prototype Testing Tools

**Moderated (recommended):** Zoom + Figma prototype link (participant shares screen), Lookback, or UserZoom.

**Unmoderated (backup):** Maze, UserTesting, or Useberry. Use when you cannot schedule 5 participants on the same day or time zones make live interviews impossible. Trade-off: no follow-up questions, less natural think-aloud, and you miss body language.

## Common Remote Sprint Failures and Fixes

### Multitasking During Sync Sessions

**Problem:** Participants check email, Slack, or work on other tasks during video calls.
**Fix:** Set a ground rule on Day 1: close all other tabs and apps during sync time. Use frequent engagement tactics: polls, voting, round-robin sharing. Keep sync blocks under 90 minutes. The Sprint Master calls on people by name regularly.

### Poor Audio/Video Quality

**Problem:** Participants join from noisy environments or with bad connections, disrupting the flow.
**Fix:** Require headphones with a microphone. Test audio/video setup the day before the sprint. Have a backup plan: phone dial-in for audio if video fails. Encourage wired internet connections over WiFi for stability.

### Miro Board Chaos

**Problem:** The Miro board becomes a mess of overlapping sticky notes, orphaned elements, and unclear structure.
**Fix:** The Sprint Master sets up the board with clear sections, labels, and locked background elements before the sprint. Only the Sprint Master should move structural elements. Use frames to contain each exercise. Lock completed sections so they are not accidentally edited.

### Lost Momentum Between Days

**Problem:** In a physical sprint, the room and the walls full of work maintain continuity. Remotely, people close their laptop and lose context overnight.
**Fix:** Start each day with a 10-minute recap. The Sprint Master walks through the Miro board, highlighting where the team left off and what happens today. Send a short end-of-day summary via Slack or email with a screenshot of the day's output.

### Sketches Are Hard to Read When Photographed

**Problem:** Participants upload blurry or poorly lit photos of their paper sketches, making the Art Museum difficult.
**Fix:** Require thick black markers (thin pens do not photograph well). Provide instructions for photographing: lay the paper flat, use good lighting, crop to the sketch only. Alternatively, allow digital sketching in Miro for participants who prefer it.

### The Decider Is Not Fully Engaged

**Problem:** The Decider joins for 10 minutes and then drops off, leaving key decisions hanging.
**Fix:** Before the sprint, get the Decider's explicit commitment to attend all voting and decision sessions. Create a "Decider schedule" showing the specific times they are needed (typically 30-60 minutes per day, not the full day). If the Decider cannot commit, postpone the sprint.

### Time Zone Conflicts Kill Participation

**Problem:** Team members in distant time zones attend at inconvenient hours and contribute less.
**Fix:** Identify the minimum overlap window and schedule all critical sync activities there. Shift the burden of inconvenience across the week. Use async exercises to maximize contribution from all time zones.

### Friday Testing Feels Disconnected

**Problem:** The team watches user interviews on video but does not feel the energy and immediacy of in-person observation.
**Fix:** Use a dedicated observation channel where team members react and note observations in real time. Between each interview, do a live 5-minute debrief on video.
