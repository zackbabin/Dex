# Multi-Channel StoryBrand Consistency

Adapting the SB7 framework across social media, video, podcasts, PR, and other channels.

## The Consistency Principle

Your brand message must be recognizable across every channel, but adapted to each platform's format and audience expectations.

**Same story, different telling.**

The core elements stay constant:
- Customer as hero
- Your brand as guide
- The problem (external, internal, philosophical)
- The plan
- Stakes (success and failure)

What changes:
- Length and format
- Tone and style
- Platform-specific conventions
- Entry point into the story

## Social Media Adaptation

### LinkedIn

**Audience:** Professional, time-constrained, seeking career/business value

**Format adaptations:**

**One-liner posts:**
```
Most [target customers] struggle with [problem].

Here's the simple solution:
[Your plan in 3 bullets]

The result? [Success outcome].

[CTA: Link or comment prompt]
```

**Story posts:**
```
Last week, a client told me they were about to [failure scenario].

Sound familiar?

Here's what they were getting wrong:
[Problem description]

We helped them [solution].

90 days later: [Success outcome].

If you're dealing with [problem], [transitional CTA].
```

**Best practices:**
- Lead with the problem or outcome
- Use short paragraphs (mobile reading)
- Professional tone, but human
- End with clear CTA or question

### Twitter/X

**Audience:** Fast-moving, opinion-driven, values wit and brevity

**Format adaptations:**

[CTA]
```

**Thread structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook (problem or bold claim)
Tweet 2-4: Story/explanation
Tweet 5: Plan (the how)
Tweet 6: Stakes (what's possible)
Tweet 7: CTA
```

**Best practices:**
- Hook in first tweet is everything
- One idea per tweet

**Format adaptations:**

**Caption structure:**
```
[Hook - first line visible]

[Problem story - relatable]

[Solution - what worked]

[Outcome - transformation]

[CTA - save, share, link in bio]

[Hashtags - relevant, not spammy]
```

**Story/Reel hooks:**
- "POV: You're struggling with [problem]"
- "3 things I wish I knew about [topic]"
- "This is what happens when [solution]"

**Best practices:**
- Visual must stop the scroll

**Format adaptations:**

**Hook patterns:**
- "Nobody tells you this about [topic]"
- "The [problem] they don't want you to know about"
- "Here's why [common approach] doesn't work"

**Structure:**
```
0-3 sec: Hook (stop scrolling)
3-15 sec: Problem/tension
15-45 sec: Solution/revelation
45-60 sec: CTA or punchline
```

**Best practices:**
- Entertainment > education
- Raw/authentic > polished
- Trend participation with brand twist
- Comment engagement is critical
