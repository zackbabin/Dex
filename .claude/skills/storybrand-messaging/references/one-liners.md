# StoryBrand One-Liners

A one-liner is a single, memorable sentence that explains what you do. It should pass the "cocktail party test"—can someone repeat it after hearing it once?

## The Formula

```
We help [CHARACTER] who struggle with [PROBLEM]
[SOLUTION/PROCESS] so they can [RESULT].
```

### Breaking it down:

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Character | Who you serve | "busy professionals" |
| Problem | Their struggle | "who don't have time to cook" |
| Solution | What you provide | "get chef-prepared meals delivered" |
| Result | The transformation | "eat healthy without the hassle" |

## One-Liner Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why it fails | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Too vague | Means nothing | "We help companies succeed" |
| Too long | Can't remember | 50+ word explanation |
| No problem | No hook | "We provide consulting services" |
| Feature-focused | Not compelling | "We offer cloud-based project management" |
| No transformation | No desire | "We do digital marketing" |
| Jargon-heavy | Confuses people | "We leverage synergies to optimize ROI" |
| Multiple audiences | Dilutes impact | "We help everyone with everything" |

## Testing Your One-Liner

### The Cocktail Party Test
Tell it to someone and walk away. 30 seconds later, can they tell someone else what you do?

### The "So What?" Test
After reading it, does it make someone want to learn more? If the response is "okay, cool," it's too weak.

### The Specificity Test
Could a competitor use the same one-liner? If yes, it's too generic.

### The Benefit Test
Is the result something people actually want? "Save time" is weak. "Get your weekends back" is strong.
