# StoryBrand Email Sequences

Structured email nurture sequences that move subscribers through the SB7 framework toward conversion.

## The Philosophy of Nurture Emails

Email isn't about broadcasting—it's about building a relationship with a potential customer who has a problem you can solve. Every email should:

1. **Provide value** (not just ask for things)
2. **Position you as the guide** (empathy + authority)
3. **Move them toward their desired transformation**

## The Welcome Sequence (5-Email Foundation)

Triggered when someone joins your email list. This sequence is critical—50%+ of your email engagement happens here.

### Email 1: Deliver and Welcome (Day 0)

**Purpose:** Deliver what they signed up for + set expectations.

**Subject lines:**
- "Your [lead magnet name] is here"
- "Here's your free [guide/checklist/etc.]"
- "[First name], your download is ready"

**Structure:**
```
Hi [Name],

[Deliver the promised resource - link/attachment]

Quick tip: Start with [section X] if you want to see results fast.

Here's what to expect from me:
- [Frequency] emails with [type of value]
- No spam, ever
- Unsubscribe anytime

Looking forward to helping you [achieve desired outcome].

[Signature]

P.S. If you have questions about [topic], just hit reply. I read every email.
```

### Email 2: Problem + Empathy (Day 2)

**Purpose:** Show you understand their struggle. Build trust through empathy.

**Subject lines:**
- "The [problem] no one talks about"
- "Why [common approach] doesn't work"
- "I struggled with this too"

**Structure:**
```
Hi [Name],

Most people trying to [achieve goal] hit the same wall: [problem].

They [common mistake they make], but that only leads to [negative outcome].

I get it. [Brief empathy statement - show you've been there or understand deeply].

The real issue isn't [surface problem]. It's [deeper problem].

In my next email, I'll share [what you'll teach next].

For now, here's one quick thing you can do: [actionable tip].

[Signature]
```

### Email 3: Authority + Proof (Day 4)

**Purpose:** Establish credibility. Show you can actually help.

**Subject lines:**
- "How [client] achieved [result]"
- "[Number] [things] we learned from [X clients/years/projects]"
- "The method behind [result]"

**Structure:**
```
Hi [Name],

Last email I mentioned [problem]. Today I want to show you what's possible.

[Case study or story]:
- [Client/person] was struggling with [problem]
- They [tried common approach] but [it didn't work]
- Then they [applied your method/worked with you]
- Result: [specific outcome]

This isn't magic. It's a process:
1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]

[Social proof: mention credentials, clients served, media features]

Tomorrow I'll share [specific tactic or next topic].

[Signature]
```

### Email 4: The Plan (Day 6)

**Purpose:** Show them the path from where they are to where they want to be.

**Subject lines:**
- "Your 3-step path to [desired outcome]"
- "The simple plan that works"
- "From [current state] to [desired state]"

**Structure:**
```
Hi [Name],

Getting from [problem state] to [success state] doesn't have to be complicated.

Here's the path I recommend:

Step 1: [Simple action name]
[Brief explanation of what this involves and why it matters]

Step 2: [Simple action name]
[Brief explanation]

Step 3: [Simple action name]
[Brief explanation]

That's it. No 47-step process. No complicated frameworks.

If you want help with [Step 1], here's a resource:
[Link to helpful content or transitional CTA]

Next email: I'll address the #1 question people ask me about [topic].

[Signature]
```

### Email 5: Direct CTA (Day 8)

**Purpose:** Make the ask. Invite them to take the next step.

**Subject lines:**
- "Ready to [achieve outcome]?"
- "Let's do this together"
- "Your next step"

**Structure:**
```
Hi [Name],

Over the past week, I've shared:
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]
- [The plan]

Now you have two choices:

1. Try to figure this out on your own (totally valid—I've given you the roadmap)

2. Let us help you [achieve outcome faster/with less struggle/guaranteed]

If you're ready for option 2, here's what to do:

[DIRECT CTA BUTTON/LINK]

Here's what happens when you [take action]:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Risk reversal - guarantee, trial, etc.]

No pressure. But if [problem] is costing you [negative outcome], waiting is the most expensive option.

[Signature]

P.S. [Deadline, limited spots, or bonus for acting now - only if genuine]
```
