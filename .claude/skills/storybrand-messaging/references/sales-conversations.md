# StoryBrand Sales Conversations

Applying the SB7 framework to sales calls, discovery questions, and objection handling.

## Sales Philosophy

**The salesperson is the guide, not the hero.**

Traditional sales puts the rep center stage: "Let me tell you about our company, our features, our awards..."

StoryBrand sales puts the customer center stage: "Tell me about your challenge. Here's how we help people like you succeed."

## The Discovery Call Structure

### Opening: Establish the Problem (5 min)

**Goal:** Confirm the customer has a problem you solve.

```
"Thanks for taking the time. Before I tell you about us, I'd love to
understand your situation. What prompted you to take this call today?"
```

**Follow-up questions:**
- "How long has this been a challenge?"
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What happens if nothing changes?"

### Exploration: Understand the Job (15 min)

**External problem:**
- "What's the tangible problem you're trying to solve?"
- "What does this cost you in time/money/resources?"

**Internal problem:**
- "How does this situation make you feel?"
- "What's frustrating about dealing with this?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this?"

**Philosophical problem:**
- "Why is it important to you to fix this?"
- "What do you believe should be possible?"

**Example:**
```
Customer: "We're losing too many leads."

External: "About how many leads are you losing? What's that costing?"
Internal: "How does your team feel about this? Frustrated? Demoralized?"
Philosophical: "What do you believe a good lead process should look like?"
```

### Positioning: Present as Guide (5 min)

**Show empathy:**
```
"I hear this a lot. The feeling of watching good leads slip away is
incredibly frustrating, especially when you've worked so hard to generate them."
```

**Establish authority:**
```
"We've helped 200+ companies solve exactly this problem. On average,
they see a 40% improvement in lead conversion within 90 days."
```

### The Plan: Show the Path (10 min)

**Three-step framework:**
```
"Here's how we typically help companies like yours:

1. First, we audit your current process to find where leads are falling out.

2. Then, we implement our system that ensures every lead gets the right
   follow-up at the right time.

3. Finally, we optimize based on data, so you continuously improve.

It's straightforward, and we handle most of the heavy lifting."
```

### Stakes: Paint Success and Failure (5 min)

**Success:**
```
"Imagine 90 days from now: your team isn't chasing leads manually anymore.
Every prospect gets followed up with automatically. Your conversion rate
has jumped 40%. How would that change things?"
```

**Failure (light touch):**
```
"On the flip side, what happens if you keep doing what you're doing?
Where will you be in a year?"
```

### Call to Action: Clear Next Step (5 min)

**Direct CTA:**
```
"Based on what you've shared, I think we can definitely help. The next
step would be a 30-minute demo where I can show you exactly how this
would work for your team. How's Thursday at 2pm?"
```

**Handle hesitation:**
```
"I totally understand wanting to think about it. Would it help if I
sent you a case study from a similar company while you consider?"
```

## Objection Handling

### Framework: Acknowledge → Explore → Reframe

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
"I hear you. That's a fair concern."

**Step 2: Explore**
"Can you tell me more about what's driving that concern?"

**Step 3: Reframe**
"What I've seen with other clients is... Would that address your concern?"

### Common Objections

#### "It's too expensive."

**Explore:**
"Help me understand—too expensive compared to what?"

**Reframe options:**
- Cost of the problem: "What's this problem costing you now?"
- ROI focus: "If this saved you $X, would the investment make sense?"
- Flexibility: "We have different options. What budget were you considering?"

#### "We need to think about it."

**Explore:**
"Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?"

**Reframe options:**
- Identify blocker: "Is there something I didn't address that's giving you pause?"
- Add urgency: "What would happen if you wait another quarter?"
- Offer help: "Would it help if I sent you materials to share with your team?"

#### "We're looking at competitors too."

**Explore:**
"Smart. What are the most important factors in your decision?"

**Reframe options:**
- Differentiate on job: "Most companies focus on X. We focus on Y because..."
- Invite comparison: "Happy to show you how we compare on those factors."
- Ask directly: "What would make us the clear choice?"

#### "Now isn't the right time."

**Explore:**
"I understand. What would make it the right time?"

**Reframe options:**
- Quantify delay: "What happens if you wait six months?"
- Find trigger: "Is there an event coming up that would change timing?"
- Stay in touch: "When should we reconnect?"

#### "I need to talk to my boss/team."

**Explore:**
"Absolutely. What do you think their main concerns will be?"

**Reframe options:**
- Arm them: "What information would help you make the case?"
- Offer to join: "Would it help if I joined a call to answer questions directly?"
- Create materials: "Can I send you a summary to share?"

## Presenting Price

### Frame Around Value First

**Bad:**
"Our service is $5,000 per month."

**Good:**
"Based on what you shared, you're losing about $20,000 per month in
unconverted leads. Our solution typically improves conversion by 40%,
which for you would mean an additional $8,000 per month. The investment
to make that happen is $5,000 per month."

### The Anchor Technique

Establish the cost of the problem before presenting price:

```
"You mentioned this problem is costing you about $50,000 annually in
lost revenue. To solve it and capture that revenue, the investment
is $12,000 per year—less than 25% of what you're currently losing."
```

### Payment Options

Offer choices that make "yes" easier:

```
"We have two options:
1. Annual: $10,000/year (saves $2,000)
2. Monthly: $1,000/month

Most clients choose annual because [benefit], but monthly works too
if that's easier for budgeting."
```
