# StoryBrand Messaging Framework

Framework for clarifying your message so customers will listen. Based on a fundamental truth: customers don't buy the best products—they buy the ones they can understand the fastest.

## Core Principle

**The customer is the hero, not your brand.** Your brand is the guide who helps the hero win. When you position yourself as the hero, you compete with your customer. When you position yourself as the guide, you serve them.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating marketing copy or brand messaging, rate it 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full alignment with all guidelines; lower scores indicate gaps to address. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The SB7 Framework

Every compelling story follows the same pattern. Use this structure for all messaging:

### 1. A Character (The Hero)

**Core concept:** The customer wants something. Every story begins with a hero who wants something. In your brand's story, the customer is the hero and your job is to define what they want. Be specific about that one desire.

**Why it works:** Opening a story gap — the distance between where a character is and where they want to be — creates tension that demands resolution. When you name a customer's desire clearly, they lean in because they feel understood and want to know how the gap gets closed.

**Key insights:**
- Open a story gap (desire creates tension that pulls people into the narrative)
- Focus on ONE desire per message (not a list — multiple desires dilute the story gap)
- The desire should relate to survival (physical, financial, relational, or spiritual)
- Aspirational identity is powerful ("become the leader everyone respects")
- Different segments may have different primary desires — create separate messaging for different roles, stages, and pain intensities

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Homepage headline | State the customer's desire as the outcome | "You want a beautiful smile" (not "our dentistry is excellent") |
| Landing page | Lead with one desire per page | "You want to retire early" (not "we offer comprehensive financial planning") |
| Audience segmentation | Tailor the desire to each segment | CEO: "Scale without chaos" vs. IC: "Do your best work without friction" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "You want [specific desire]..."
- "Imagine [aspirational identity]..."
- "What if you could [single clear outcome]?"
- "You deserve [survival-level desire]..."

**Ethical boundary:** Never fabricate desires the customer does not actually hold. Ground the desire in real research, interviews, or observed behavior — not manufactured aspiration.

See: [references/brand-script.md](references/brand-script.md)

### 2. Has a Problem

**Core concept:** The hero faces a problem that stands in the way of getting what they want. Every story needs conflict. Define the problem at three levels — external, internal, and philosophical — and personify it with a villain that gives the problem a face.

**Why it works:** Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems. When you name how the problem makes them feel — confused, overwhelmed, embarrassed — you tap into the emotional driver that actually motivates purchasing decisions.

**Key insights:**
- External problems are tangible and surface-level ("my investments are scattered")
- Internal problems are emotional ("I feel confused and overwhelmed")
- Philosophical problems frame the injustice ("People shouldn't have to be experts to retire well")
- The villain personifies the problem — a good villain is specific and relatable, not abstract
- Most brands only address external problems, missing the internal problems that truly drive purchases
- Bad villain: "complexity" (abstract); Good villain: "Wall Street jargon designed to confuse you"

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Problem section on website | Name all three levels of the problem | External: "Scattered tools." Internal: "You feel overwhelmed." Philosophical: "Teams deserve clarity." |
| Email nurture sequence | Lead with the internal problem | "Tired of feeling like you're guessing?" |
| Ad copy | Personify the villain | "Stop letting confusing software steal your evenings." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "You're tired of [internal problem]..."
- "[Villain] has been keeping you from [desire]..."
- "It's not right that [philosophical problem]..."
- "You've tried everything but [external problem] persists because [villain]..."

**Ethical boundary:** Never exaggerate problems to create unnecessary fear. Name real frustrations honestly; do not invent suffering the customer has not experienced.

See: [references/brand-script.md](references/brand-script.md)

### 3. And Meets a Guide

**Core concept:** Enter the guide — a character who has empathy AND authority. Your brand is the guide, not the hero. You demonstrate empathy by understanding the customer's pain, and authority by proving you can actually solve it. The balance of both is what earns trust.

**Why it works:** Customers are not looking for another hero — they are looking for a guide. Think Yoda, not Luke. When a brand expresses empathy, the customer feels seen. When the brand demonstrates authority (testimonials, logos, statistics), the customer feels safe. Together, these two qualities create the trust needed for a customer to engage.

**Key insights:**
- Empathy without authority makes you seem weak; authority without empathy makes you seem arrogant
- Demonstrate empathy with "we understand" language and by accurately describing their frustration
- Demonstrate authority with testimonials, client logos, statistics, awards, and years of experience
- Never tell your origin story as the centerpiece — that is hero behavior
- Brief, relevant credentials are fine; a multi-paragraph "our journey" story loses the customer

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| About page | Lead with empathy, then show credentials | "We know what it's like to feel lost in financial jargon. That's why 10,000 families trust us." |
| Homepage social proof | Combine empathy headline with authority logos | "You're not alone. Join 5,000+ teams who found clarity." + client logos |
| Sales call | Open with empathy, close with authority | "I hear you — that sounds frustrating. Here's what we've seen work for teams like yours." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "We understand what it's like to [empathy statement]..."
- "In our experience working with [authority reference]..."
- "We've helped [number] [customers] achieve [result]..."
- "You don't have to figure this out alone..."

**Ethical boundary:** Never claim authority you have not earned. Testimonials must be real, statistics must be accurate, and credentials must be verifiable.

See: [references/sales-conversations.md](references/sales-conversations.md)

### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan

**Core concept:** The guide gives the hero a plan. Plans create clarity and reduce the fear of doing business with you. There are two types: a Process Plan (3-4 steps showing how to work with you) and an Agreement Plan (commitments you make to remove risk).

**Why it works:** Customers feel uncertain before making a purchase. A clear, simple plan acts as stepping stones across a creek — it shows them exactly how to get from where they are to where they want to be. Without a plan, the path feels murky and they stall. Plans reduce cognitive load and perceived risk.

**Key insights:**
- Process Plan: 3-4 numbered steps to work with you (e.g., "1. Schedule a call. 2. Get a custom plan. 3. Start seeing results.")
- Agreement Plan: commitments that remove fear (e.g., "100% satisfaction guaranteed", "Cancel anytime", "We'll never pressure you")
- Limit to 3-4 steps maximum — more than that overwhelms
- Use action verbs for each step
- Number the steps to imply order and ease
- Give each step a simple, memorable name

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Website plan section | Show 3-step process with icons | "1. Book a demo. 2. Get onboarded. 3. See results in 30 days." |
| Pricing page | Add agreement plan to reduce purchase anxiety | "No contracts. Cancel anytime. 30-day money-back guarantee." |
| Email CTA | Reference the plan to simplify next steps | "Getting started is simple — just three steps." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Here's how it works: Step 1... Step 2... Step 3..."
- "Getting started is easy. Just [step 1]."
- "We promise [agreement plan commitment]."
- "Your plan is simple: [3 clear steps]."

**Ethical boundary:** Never promise outcomes in the plan that you cannot reliably deliver. Agreement plan commitments must be honored without exception.

See: [references/brand-script.md](references/brand-script.md)

### 5. And Calls Them to Action

**Core concept:** The guide calls the hero to action. If you don't ask, they won't act. There are two types: a Direct CTA (the primary action you want them to take) and a Transitional CTA (a lower-commitment alternative for those not yet ready).

**Why it works:** Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action. A clear, repeated, visually prominent call to action tells the customer exactly what to do next. The transitional CTA captures people who aren't ready to buy but are willing to engage — keeping them in your story until they are ready.

**Key insights:**
- Direct CTA: "Buy Now", "Schedule a Call", "Get Started" — the primary conversion action
- Transitional CTA: "Download Free Guide", "Watch Demo", "Take the Quiz" — lower commitment
- Use a button (not a text link) for the Direct CTA
- Make the Direct CTA stand out visually (contrasting color)
- Repeat the Direct CTA multiple times on the page
- Use action language ("Get" not "Submit")
- Every page should have one obvious Direct CTA and optionally one Transitional CTA

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Homepage | Direct CTA button above the fold, repeated below | "Get Started Free" button in header and after each section |
| Blog post | Transitional CTA at the end | "Download our free checklist" after a how-to article |
| Email | Single Direct CTA per email | "Schedule Your Call" button, one per message |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Get [desired result] now."
- "Start your free [trial/demo/assessment] today."
- "Download your free [lead magnet]."
- "Schedule a [time-bound commitment] — it's free."

**Ethical boundary:** Never disguise a purchase as a free action. CTAs must honestly represent what happens when the customer clicks.

See: [references/website-wireframe.md](references/website-wireframe.md)

### 6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure

**Core concept:** Paint a picture of what happens if the customer does not act. Without stakes, there is no story. Failure gives the narrative tension and urgency — it shows the cost of inaction.

**Why it works:** Humans are loss-averse. The fear of losing something is more motivating than the promise of gaining something. A taste of what could go wrong — not a full scare campaign — creates the emotional stakes needed for a customer to move from "interested" to "committed."

**Key insights:**
- Don't overdo fear — just a taste of the negative consequence is enough
- Be honest about real consequences, not hypothetical catastrophes
- Focus on opportunity cost, not punishment ("another year of feeling stuck")
- Use "what if you don't" framing to make inaction feel costly
- Pair failure messaging with success messaging to create contrast
- Examples: "How long will you wait before getting this handled?" or "Don't let another year go by feeling overwhelmed"

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Landing page stakes section | Brief failure scenario before the CTA | "Without a clear message, you'll keep losing customers to competitors they understand faster." |
| Email subject line | Light urgency referencing failure | "Are you leaving revenue on the table?" |
| Sales conversation | Name the cost of inaction | "What happens to your team if nothing changes in the next 6 months?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Don't let [negative outcome] happen when [solution] is this simple."
- "How long will you wait before [addressing the problem]?"
- "Without [your solution], [realistic negative consequence]."
- "Every day without [solution], you're [cost of inaction]."

**Ethical boundary:** Never use fear-mongering, fabricated urgency, or worst-case scenarios designed to panic. State real, proportionate consequences of inaction.

See: [references/brand-script.md](references/brand-script.md)

### 7. And Ends in Success

**Core concept:** Paint a vivid picture of what life looks like after the customer works with you. Success is the resolution of the story — it closes the story gap opened in Element 1. Define success in terms of status, completeness, and self-realization.

**Why it works:** People need to see the destination before they start the journey. A clear success picture gives customers something concrete to desire. When you show the transformation — not just the features — customers can place themselves in that future and feel the emotional pull toward it.

**Key insights:**
- Status: How will they be perceived? ("Become the go-to expert in your field")
- Completeness: What gap will be closed? ("Finally have financial peace of mind")
- Self-realization: Who will they become? ("Be the leader you were meant to be")
- Show the transformation with before/after comparisons
- Use customer success stories with specific outcomes (numbers, results)
- The success picture should be specific and tangible, not vague or generic

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Homepage success section | Paint the after picture with specifics | "Imagine opening your inbox to qualified leads every morning — no cold outreach required." |
| Case study | Show before/after transformation with numbers | "Before: 2% conversion rate. After: 11% in 90 days." |
| Testimonial placement | Let customers describe their own success | "I finally feel like I know where every dollar is going." — real customer quote |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Imagine [specific success picture]..."
- "Join [number] [customers] who now [success outcome]..."
- "What would it mean for you to [self-realization outcome]?"
- "Finally, [completeness outcome] — without [old frustration]."

**Ethical boundary:** Never promise results you cannot substantiate. Success pictures must reflect realistic outcomes, and testimonials must represent genuine customer experiences.

See: [references/brand-script.md](references/brand-script.md)

## The One-Liner

A single sentence that clearly explains what you do. Use it everywhere.

**Formula:**
```
[Problem] + [Solution] + [Result]
```

**Structure:**
"We help [CHARACTER] who struggle with [PROBLEM] to [SOLUTION] so they can [RESULT]."

**Examples:**
- "We help busy parents who struggle to cook healthy meals get fresh ingredients delivered weekly so they can feed their family nutritious food without the stress."
- "We help small business owners who feel overwhelmed by marketing create a clear message so they can grow their revenue."

**Test:** Can someone repeat it after hearing it once?

See: [references/one-liners.md](references/one-liners.md)

## Tone and Voice Guidelines

Your brand voice should be consistent across all channels while adapting to context:

**Guide qualities to convey:**
- Empathy: "We understand..."
- Authority: "In our experience..."
- Confidence: "Here's what works..."
- Helpfulness: "Let us show you..."

**Avoid:**
- Hero language: "We're the best at..."
- Jargon: Use customer's words
- Condescension: Respect their intelligence
- Weakness: Be confident, not tentative

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Being the hero | Competes with customer | Position as guide |
| Multiple messages | Confuses people | One clear message per asset |
| Clever > clear | People don't decode messaging | Choose clarity always |
| Feature-focused | Customers care about transformation | Lead with outcomes |
| No clear CTA | No direction = no action | Ask for the sale |
| No stakes | No urgency = no motivation | Paint failure picture |
| Starting with "We" | Self-focused | Start with customer's problem |

## Quick Diagnostic

Ask these questions about any marketing asset:

1. [ ] Can a caveman understand what you offer in 5 seconds?
2. [ ] Is the customer clearly the hero?
3. [ ] Have you identified internal problem, not just external?
4. [ ] Do you demonstrate empathy AND authority?
5. [ ] Is there a clear 3-step plan?
6. [ ] Is there one obvious CTA?
7. [ ] Do you show success AND failure stakes?

If any answer is "no" — that's your problem.
