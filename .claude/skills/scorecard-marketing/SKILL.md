# Scorecard Marketing Skill

A proven 4-step system for generating qualified leads through interactive assessments. This approach generates warm leads with rich data about each prospect.

## Core Principle

**Everything is downstream from lead generation.** People buy to resolve psychological tension between their current reality and desired reality. A scorecard awakens dormant desires by asking revealing questions.

**The foundation:** While people actively searching are harder to sell to (already decided, set budget), those with dormant desires buy from whoever helped them uncover the need. A well-designed scorecard converts 30-50% of visitors vs. 3-10% for traditional PDF lead magnets, because interactive assessments create psychological engagement that static content cannot.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating assessment funnels or quiz landing pages, rate them 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full alignment with all guidelines; lower scores indicate gaps to address. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The 4-Step Scorecard System

### 1. Landing Page

**Core concept:** The landing page exists for one purpose: get visitors to start the questionnaire. It must create enough curiosity and promise enough value that clicking "Start" feels irresistible.

**Why it works:** A concept hook taps into a dormant desire the visitor didn't know they had. By framing the assessment around a score, you trigger the primal drive to measure, rank, and improve oneself. The combination of curiosity and low commitment ("takes 3 minutes") removes friction.

**Key insights:**
- The concept hook is the single most important element; it defines what visitors score themselves on
- "Moving toward" hooks ("Are you ready to [goal]?") outperform fear-based hooks
- The 3 Cs (Clarity, Credibility, Connection) must all be present on the page
- Offering bonuses (free book, consultation, report) lifts completion rates significantly
- Time expectation ("Takes less than 3 minutes") reduces abandonment before start

**Product applications:**

| Context | Landing Page Element | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Concept hook** | Frame around a score visitors want | "What's Your Marketing Score?" |
| **Moving toward** | Goal-oriented hook | "Are you ready to scale your business?" |
| **Removing pain** | Pain-relief hook | "Reduce your hiring frustration - take this quiz" |
| **Readiness check** | Decision validation hook | "Should you launch a second location? Complete this checklist" |
| **Category discovery** | Identity/type hook | "What type of entrepreneur are you?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "[HEADLINE: Concept hook + promise] Are you ready to [desired outcome]?"
- "Answer [X] quick questions to discover [specific insight] and get personalized recommendations"
- "3 bullet benefits: Find out where you're strong / Identify areas holding you back / Get actionable next steps tailored to you"
- "Based on [X years] working with [X clients]. Featured in [publications]. Trusted by [names/logos]."
- "[CTA BUTTON] Start the Quiz (Takes less than 3 minutes)"

**Ethical boundary:** The concept hook must promise value the assessment actually delivers. Never bait-and-switch with a compelling hook that leads to a sales pitch disguised as results.

See: [references/industry-examples.md](references/industry-examples.md) for 50+ specific scorecard concepts and landing page hooks across industries.

### 2. Questionnaire

**Core concept:** The questionnaire collects lead data while providing an engaging, gamified experience. It captures contact information first, then asks scored questions grouped into categories that surface the prospect's pain points, desires, and qualification signals.

**Why it works:** People enjoy answering questions about themselves (self-referential encoding). By capturing the email before questions begin, you retain the lead even if they abandon. Scored categories create a structured framework that makes results feel scientific and credible, increasing trust in the recommendations that follow.

**Key insights:**
- Lead capture form goes first (name, email, optional phone) so you have data even on abandonment
- Question count scales with funnel stage: 8-15 for cold-to-warm, 20-50 for warm-to-sales, 30-150 for client-to-fan
- Group questions into 2-7 measurable categories (e.g., Marketing, Operations, Leadership)
- Assign 1-5 points per answer and weight significant answers higher
- Add qualifying questions in an "Uncategorised" group: budget, urgency, company size
- Avoid salesy questions, leading questions, lookup questions, and jargon

**Product applications:**

| Context | Question Type | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Yes/No** | Checklist items | "Do you work out 3+ times/week?" |
| **Sliding scale** | Degree/frequency | "How important is X to you?" |
| **Radio buttons** | Single choice | "Which best describes your situation?" |
| **Checkboxes** | Multiple selections | "Which tools do you use?" |
| **Open text** | Rare, slows completion | "What has stopped you in the past?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- Questions should feel like a conversation, not an interrogation
- Use "you" language: "How confident are you in your..." not "Rate your confidence level in..."
- Category names should be meaningful to the respondent, not internal jargon
- Progress indicators ("Question 5 of 12") reduce abandonment
- Closing with "Almost done!" maintains momentum on longer assessments

**Ethical boundary:** Never disguise sales qualification as helpful assessment. Qualifying questions should be transparently useful to both parties. Avoid collecting data you do not need or will not use to improve the respondent's results.

See: [references/psychology.md](references/psychology.md) for the psychological foundations of question design and tension creation.

### 3. Results Page

**Core concept:** The results page delivers personalized value based on the respondent's score, creating tension between where they are and where they could be, while guiding them toward a clear next step calibrated to their tier.

**Why it works:** Personalized results trigger reciprocity (you gave them insight, they feel open to conversation), self-qualification (they told you their problems), and gamification (the primal drive to improve a score). Research shows 83% of consumers will share data for a personalized experience, and scored results feel more valuable than generic advice.

**Key insights:**
- Show overall score plus category breakdown to highlight strengths and weaknesses
- Dynamic content per tier ensures every respondent gets relevant advice, not generic filler
- Default tiers are Low / Medium / High; custom tiers (e.g., "Startup / Scaleup / Performer / Unicorn") increase engagement
- The sweet spot is prospects who score "strong foundations with room to improve" as they are most likely to convert
- PDF reports (personalized cover, detailed recommendations) extend value and are shareable in sales meetings
- Different CTAs per tier (Low: free event; Medium: book + discovery call; High: direct consultation)

**Product applications:**

| Context | Results Element | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Overall score** | Total across all categories | "Your Marketing Score: 67/100" |
| **Category breakdown** | Visual strengths/weaknesses | Spider chart showing 5 category scores |
| **Low tier content** | Easy first steps + nurture offer | "This area needs attention. Here are easy first steps..." |
| **High tier content** | Advanced offer + premium CTA | "Excellent foundation! We work with advanced clients on [offer]" |
| **PDF report** | Personalized downloadable document | Cover with name, detailed category analysis, recommendations |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Your [Topic] Score is [X]/[Total]. Here's what that means..."
- "Your strongest area is [category]. Your biggest opportunity is [category]."
- Low tier: "This area needs attention. Here are easy first steps... Our team specializes in helping people at your stage."
- High tier: "Excellent foundation! Focus on maintaining standards. We work with advanced clients like yourself on [specific advanced offer]."
- "Want to improve your score? Here's your personalized next step..."

**Ethical boundary:** Results must deliver genuine insight, not manufactured anxiety. Low scorers should receive actionable help, not just a sales pitch. Never inflate or deflate scores to push prospects toward a particular offer.

### 4. Sales and Marketing

**Core concept:** The fourth step turns assessment data into a systematic sales and marketing engine. Promotion drives traffic to the landing page, while follow-up sequences segment leads by score tier and nurture them with relevant content toward a conversion event.

**Why it works:** Unlike cold outreach, scorecard-generated leads arrive with rich self-reported data: their pain points, qualification signals, and score. Sales conversations shift from discovery to recommendation because you already know their scores before the call. Automated segmentation means every lead gets relevant follow-up without manual sorting.

**Key insights:**
- Promotion channels include LinkedIn polls, Facebook/Google ads, email to existing lists, podcast CTAs, and book QR codes
- Automated email with results + PDF fires immediately after completion
- Abandon emails recover leads who started but did not finish
- Segmented nurture campaigns by tier deliver relevant content (not one-size-fits-all drip)
- Sales outreach to high-qualifiers is warm because their data is visible to the rep
- Multi-step funnels work for high-ticket: Stage 1 (8-15 questions, basic score), Stage 2 (15-25, detailed report), Stage 3 (30-50, baseline + roadmap)

**Product applications:**

| Context | Sales/Marketing Tactic | Example |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| **Promotion** | LinkedIn engagement | Post a poll asking which scorecard concept they prefer |
| **Paid traffic** | Facebook/Google ads to landing page | "What's Your Leadership Score? Take the free quiz" |
| **Follow-up** | Automated results email | Email with score summary, PDF attachment, and CTA |
| **Abandonment** | Recovery email sequence | "You started the quiz but didn't finish. Your progress is saved." |
| **Sales call** | Data-informed conversation | Rep opens with "I see you scored 4/10 on Operations..." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Take the [Topic] Scorecard" as a universal CTA across all channels
- Abandon email: "You started the quiz but didn't finish. Pick up where you left off."
- Results email: "Your [Topic] Score is ready. Here's what we recommend based on your results."
- Sales outreach: "I noticed you scored well in [area] but [area] might be holding you back. Can we talk about that?"
- Nurture: "Last week you scored [X] on [category]. Here are 3 ways to improve that score this month."

**Ethical boundary:** Follow-up must respect consent and provide genuine value. Never use assessment data to pressure or manipulate. Segmented emails should help, not just sell. Honor unsubscribe requests immediately and never share individual assessment data without permission.

## Scorecard Naming Strategy

**Effective names combine:**
- Topic clarity (what it measures)
- Outcome promise (why take it)
- Brevity (memorable)

**Formulas:**
- "The [Topic] Scorecard"
- "[Outcome] Readiness Assessment"
- "What's Your [Topic] Score?"
- "The [Adjective] [Topic] Quiz"

**Examples:**
- "The Business Growth Scorecard"
- "Leadership Readiness Assessment"
- "What's Your Marketing Score?"
- "The Complete Wellness Quiz"

## Conversion Benchmarks

- Traditional PDF lead magnets: 3-10% conversion
- Scorecard/quiz funnels: 30-50% conversion
- Top performers: 70%+ with optimized landing pages

## Psychology Behind Why This Works

1. **Tension creation:** Questions surface dormant desires
2. **Reciprocity:** You gave value (insights), they're open to conversation
3. **Self-qualification:** They told you their problems and budget
4. **Personalization:** 83% of consumers share data for personalized experience
5. **Gamification:** Primal drive to score, rank, and improve
6. **Commitment:** They invested time, increasing likelihood of follow-through

## Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Define ideal customer and their desired outcome
2. [ ] Choose concept hook (readiness/category/knowledge/pain removal)
3. [ ] Write 2-7 scoring categories based on your methodology
4. [ ] Create 10-40 questions with point values
5. [ ] Set up 3 scoring tiers with dynamic content
6. [ ] Write landing page with 3 Cs (Clarity, Credibility, Connection)
7. [ ] Configure lead form fields
8. [ ] Set up automated email with results
9. [ ] Create follow-up sequence by tier
10. [ ] Test with 5-10 people before launch

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Too many questions for cold traffic** | Abandonment spikes after 15 questions for first-time visitors | Use 8-15 questions for cold audiences; save 20-50 for warm leads |
| **Capturing email after the quiz** | Lose all abandon leads; only get completers | Move lead capture form before the first question |
| **Generic results for all score tiers** | No personalization means no tension, no reason to act | Write unique dynamic content per tier per category |
| **Salesy questions that break trust** | "Are you ready to buy?" signals the quiz is a disguised pitch | Frame questions around the respondent's situation, not your offer |
| **No clear CTA on the results page** | Prospect gets their score and leaves with nowhere to go | Offer a specific, tier-appropriate next step |
| **One-size-fits-all follow-up emails** | Low scorers and high scorers need different messages and offers | Segment nurture campaigns by score tier |
| **Skipping the concept hook** | Without a compelling hook, the landing page has no pull | Test 3-5 concept hooks with your audience before committing |

## Quick Diagnostic

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Does the concept hook target a dormant desire? | Landing page will underperform | Rewrite hook using one of the 5 hook types (moving toward, pain removal, readiness, category, knowledge) |
| Is email captured before questions begin? | Losing all abandon leads | Move lead capture form to precede the questionnaire |
| Are questions grouped into scored categories? | Results will feel arbitrary | Create 2-7 measurable categories and assign point values |
| Does each score tier have unique dynamic content? | Results feel generic, no tension to improve | Write personalized insights and CTAs for Low, Medium, and High tiers |
| Is there a specific CTA per tier on the results page? | Prospects leave without converting | Map each tier to a relevant next step (event, call, consultation) |
| Are follow-up emails segmented by score? | Nurture campaigns feel irrelevant | Build separate email sequences per tier with tailored content |
