# Buyer Psychology & Tension Creation

## Why People Buy: Psychological Tension

All purchases resolve psychological tension - the gap between current reality and desired reality.

### Three Types of Tension

| Type | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Pain-based** | Something you have that you wish would stop | "My business is too dependent on me" |
| **Desire-based** | Something you don't have but want | "I want the freedom to travel while earning" |
| **Frustration-based** | Something not working as it should | "My marketing isn't generating leads" |

### Dormant vs Active Desires

**Active desire:** Person is already searching for solutions
- Harder to sell to (already decided, set budget)
- Looking for established brands, social proof
- Comparing options

**Dormant desire:** Tension exists but not acted upon
- Easier to influence (open to options)
- Will buy from whoever awakened the desire
- Open to exploring price ranges

**The scorecard targets dormant desires by asking revealing questions.**

## The 3 Conditions for Purchase

All three must be present for a sale:

### 1. Emotion
- Feeling respected and understood
- Trust established
- Emotional payoff visualized
- Stories with heroes, struggles, triumphs

### 2. Logic  
- Clear ROI calculation
- Cost-benefit analysis understood
- Comparison with alternatives favorable
- Facts, statistics, data supporting decision

### 3. Urgency
- Cost of inaction is clear
- Limited availability/time
- Price may increase
- Quality may deteriorate
- Opportunity may pass

**A scorecard creates a loop of all three:**
- Landing page: Emotional hooks + logical benefits
- Questions: Engagement creating emotional investment
- Results: Quantified logic + urgent next step

## Scoring Psychology

### Why Scoring Works

Humans have primal drives to:
- **Measure** everything that can be measured
- **Rank** themselves against standards
- **Improve** and optimize continuously

This is evolutionary - ancestors who didn't measure and improve didn't survive.

### The Power of Quantification

When you ask "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with [X]?":
- Emotion (the dissatisfaction) meets logic (the number)
- Below 4 = unbearable, will take action
- 7+ = satisfactory, low motivation
- Sweet spot: 4-6 (knows there's a problem, sees possibility)

### The Feedback Effect

- Gold stars motivate preschoolers
- Stock price motivates CEOs
- Scores motivate everyone in between

Scorecard results provide the feedback loop people crave.

## Warming Up Leads

### Google's ZMOT (Zero Moment of Truth)
People consume ~11 pieces of content before purchasing.

### Dunbar's Research
Multiple quality interactions over time accelerate trust.

### Implication for Scorecards

The scorecard isn't the end - it's the beginning of a content journey:

1. **Scorecard** (5 min) - Initial engagement, data collected
2. **Results email** - Personalized, links to relevant content
3. **Educational content** - Based on their weak areas
4. **Social proof** - Case studies matching their situation
5. **Offer** - Positioned as path of least resistance

## Path of Least Resistance

After creating tension, offer clear resolution:

### Forms of Path of Least Resistance

1. **Methodology** - Named, step-by-step process
   - "The 5P Method" / "The 3-Step System"
   - Shows you've solved this before

2. **Product/Service Bundle** - Curated solution
   - Removes decision fatigue
   - "Everything you need to achieve [result]"

3. **Intervention** - Change of direction
   - Stop doing wrong thing
   - Start doing right thing
   - Value based on outcome, not time

### The Perfect Fit Principle

**Without questions first:**
> "I have the perfect solution for you!" → Skepticism

**After questions answered:**
> "Based on your answers, here's what I recommend..." → Trust

The scorecard earns the right to recommend.

## Common Psychological Mistakes

### In Questions
- **Asking obvious leading questions** - Feels manipulative
- **Too many open-ended questions** - Decision fatigue
- **Industry jargon** - Excludes, doesn't include

### In Results
- **Same content regardless of score** - Breaks personalization promise
- **Only negative feedback** - Demotivates action
- **No clear next step** - Momentum dies

### In Follow-up
- **Generic emails** - Wastes the data collected
- **Too aggressive** - Breaks trust built
- **Too passive** - Misses the moment of motivation

## Emotion/Logic/Urgency in Practice

### Landing Page Example

**Emotion (Visual):** Happy couple reviewing finances together

**Logic (Copy):** "This assessment is based on 15 years of research with 10,000+ households. You'll discover your exact score across 5 key areas."

**Urgency (CTA):** "Get your free score now - results instantly delivered"

### Results Page Example

**Emotion:** "You've built a solid foundation. Here's what's possible..."

**Logic:** "Your Marketing score of 42% is below the 67% benchmark for businesses at your stage."

**Urgency:** "Book a free strategy call this week and receive our exclusive [bonus] - only 3 spots remaining."
