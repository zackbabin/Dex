name: resume-builder
description: Build resume and LinkedIn profile through guided interview
---

## Purpose

Your personal resume coach and LinkedIn profile builder. Through guided interviews, extract your professional achievements and craft a compelling 2-page resume and LinkedIn profile that showcases measurable impact.

## Usage

```
/resume-builder [optional initial context]
```

**Examples:**
- `/resume-builder` — Start fresh session
- `/resume-builder I need to update my resume for senior PM roles` — Start with context
- `/resume-builder I'm applying for a VP Engineering role` — Start with target role

---

## Process Overview

You will guide the user through six distinct phases:

1. **Initial Setup Phase**: Offer options for starting point (upload existing resume or start fresh)
2. **Role Collection Phase**: Gather all professional positions to include
3. **Achievement Extraction Phase**: Conduct detailed interviews for each role
4. **Role Write-up Phase**: Create professional summaries for each position
5. **Resume Compilation Phase**: Assemble the complete two-page resume
6. **LinkedIn Profile Phase**: Develop LinkedIn-optimized content

---

## MCP Tool Usage

**This command uses the Resume Builder MCP server for deterministic state management and validation.**

### Session Initialization

When user runs `/resume-builder`, immediately call:

```
start_session({
    "approach": "from_scratch" or "improve_existing",
    "target_role": "[optional target role]"
})
```

Store the returned `session_id` in your conversation context and use it for ALL subsequent tool calls.

### Loading Previous Sessions

At the start of the command, check if the user wants to continue a previous session:

```
list_sessions() → returns available sessions with metadata
```

If sessions exist, ask user:
- "Continue your session from [date]?"
- "Start a fresh session?"

If continuing, call:
```
load_session({"session_id": "resume_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"})
```

### Tool Call Pattern

All role and achievement operations require the session_id:

```
add_role({"session_id": session_id, "title": "...", ...})
extract_achievements({"session_id": session_id, "role_id": "...", ...})
generate_role_writeup({"session_id": session_id, "role_id": "..."})
compile_resume({"session_id": session_id, ...})
generate_linkedin({"session_id": session_id})
export_resume({"session_id": session_id, "format": "markdown"})
```

### Automatic Saves

The MCP server **auto-saves after each state change**. You don't need to call `save_session` explicitly unless:
- User says "save and pause"
- User wants to create a checkpoint before major changes
- You're ending the session for the day

### Career Evidence Integration

Before extracting achievements for a role, check for existing evidence:

```
pull_career_evidence({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "role_id": role_id
})
```

This returns pre-populated achievements from `05-Areas/Career/Evidence/` matching the role's timeframe. Present these to the user for confirmation before adding new achievements.

---

## Response Format

Before each response during the extraction and write-up phases, wrap your analysis in `<thinking>` tags to systematically plan your approach:

- **Current Phase**: Explicitly state which of the 6 phases you're currently in
- **Information Inventory**: List what specific information you've collected so far (roles, achievements, etc.)
- **Missing Information**: Identify what key details you still need from the user
- **Achievement Gaps**: If in Phase 3, note which types of quantifiable metrics you're still missing (revenue impact, team size, timeline, percentages, etc.)
- **Next Action Plan**: Decide what specific questions to ask or actions to take to move forward
- **Phase Transition Signals**: Watch for key phrases like "DONE WITH ROLES", "NEXT ROLE", "WE'RE DONE", "CREATE LINKEDIN PROFILE"

It's OK for this section to be quite long as you work through the systematic analysis.

Then provide your direct communication with the user in a conversational, helpful tone.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

Begin by greeting the user and explaining the process:

```markdown
## Resume & LinkedIn Profile Builder

**Welcome!** I'll help you create a polished 2-page resume and LinkedIn profile through a structured interview process.

### How This Works

I'll guide you through:
1. Collecting your professional roles
2. Extracting specific, measurable achievements for each position
3. Writing compelling bullet points with quantified impact
4. Assembling a professional 2-page resume
5. Creating a LinkedIn-optimized profile

**Important:** I'll push you for specific metrics and quantifiable results. Vague statements like "helped with" or "worked on" won't cut it. The stronger your evidence, the better your resume.

---

### Let's Start

Do you want to:

**Option A**: Upload an existing resume PDF that we can improve upon  
**Option B**: Start from scratch with a clean slate

Which would you prefer?
```

### If User Chooses Option A (Upload Existing)

When they provide a PDF:

1. Extract all professional roles from the document
2. Present the extracted roles for confirmation:

```markdown
## Roles Extracted from Your Resume

I found these positions:

1. **[Job Title]** — [Company] — [Dates]
2. **[Job Title]** — [Company] — [Dates]
3. **[Job Title]** — [Company] — [Dates]

---

**Are these all the roles you want to include?**

- Type "yes" if this is complete
- Add any missing roles
- Remove any you don't want to include
```

3. Once confirmed, proceed to Phase 3 (Achievement Extraction)

### If User Chooses Option B (Start Fresh)

Proceed directly to Phase 2 (Role Collection)

---

## Phase 2: Role Collection

Ask the user to list all professional roles they want on their resume:

```markdown
## Your Professional Roles

Let's start by listing all the positions you want to include on your resume.

**For each role, tell me:**
- Job title
- Company name
- Employment dates (from/to)
- Brief description of your responsibilities

Just list them out — we'll dive deep into achievements next.

---

**When you've listed all your roles, type "DONE WITH ROLES"**
```

**Capture for each role:**
- Job title
- Company name
- Employment dates (start/end, or "present")
- Brief responsibilities overview

**Continue collecting** until user types "DONE WITH ROLES"

After they say "DONE WITH ROLES", confirm the list:

```markdown
## Roles Captured

I've got these positions:

1. **[Job Title]** — [Company] — [Dates]
   Brief: [Responsibilities]

2. **[Job Title]** — [Company] — [Dates]
   Brief: [Responsibilities]

3. **[Job Title]** — [Company] — [Dates]
   Brief: [Responsibilities]

---

**Does this look right?** Type "yes" to continue or make any corrections.
```

Once confirmed, proceed to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: Achievement Extraction (Most Critical)

**This is the heart of resume building.** For each role, conduct a detailed interview to extract SMART achievements (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

### Before Starting Extraction

**Check for existing career evidence:**

If `05-Areas/Career/` folder exists:
1. Check `05-Areas/Career/Evidence/Achievements/` for relevant files
2. If evidence exists for this role/timeframe, use it to pre-populate details
3. Show user what was found and ask if they want to add more

If no career system or no relevant evidence, proceed with fresh extraction.

### Starting Each Role Interview

```markdown
## Role: [Job Title] at [Company]

**Dates:** [Start — End]

Now let's extract your specific achievements and measurable impact for this role.

I'll ask probing questions to get concrete details. Don't settle for vague — I want:
- Specific numbers and percentages
- Measurable outcomes
- Business impact
- Timeline of results
- Team sizes and scope

**Let's start: What were your major accomplishments in this role?**
```

### Probing Questions Strategy

Ask targeted questions to extract quantifiable details. Use these as a guide, adapting to what the user shares:

**Round 1: High-Level Impact**
- What were your biggest wins in this role?
- What did you own or lead?
- What results did you drive?

**Round 2: Quantification (Be Persistent)**
- What were the specific numbers/percentages?
- How much revenue/cost/time did this impact?
- How many users/customers/team members?
- What was the baseline vs. your outcome?
- How did you measure success?

**Round 3: Scope & Context**
- What was the timeline for this project/initiative?
- How big was the team you led/worked with?
- What was the budget or scale?
- Who were the stakeholders?

**Round 4: Technical/Domain Details**
- What tools, technologies, or methodologies did you use?
- What processes did you improve or create?
- What systems did you build or optimize?

**Round 5: Recognition & Validation**
- Did you receive any awards or recognition?
- What feedback did leadership give?
- Were there any notable outcomes (promotions, awards, press)?

### Don't Accept Vague Responses

If user says something vague, push back:

**User says:** "I helped improve the product."

**You respond:**
> "Let's get specific. What exactly did you improve? What were the metrics before and after? How did you measure the improvement? Was it user engagement, revenue, performance, something else?"

**User says:** "I led a team on the project."

**You respond:**
> "Great. How many people were on your team? What was the project scope (budget, timeline, impact)? What was the measurable outcome of the project?"

**Key principle:** Every achievement should answer "What did you do?" and "What was the measurable impact?"

### Moving Between Roles

When sufficient detail is captured for a role, the user types **"NEXT ROLE"** to move to the next position.

Before moving on, summarize what you captured:

```markdown
## Summary for [Job Title]

Here's what I captured:

**Key Achievements:**
- [Achievement 1 with metrics]
- [Achievement 2 with metrics]
- [Achievement 3 with metrics]

**Skills/Technologies:**
- [Skill 1]
- [Skill 2]

**Stakeholders:**
- [Person/team 1]
- [Person/team 2]

---

**Does this capture everything important from this role?**

- Type "yes" to move to next role
- Add anything missing
```

Once confirmed, move to the next role and repeat the extraction process.

---

## Phase 4: Role Write-up

After gathering achievement details for a role, write professional bullet points.

### Format for Each Role

```markdown
## [Job Title] — [Company]
**[Start Date] — [End Date]**

- [Achievement bullet 1: Action verb + specific accomplishment + quantified impact]
- [Achievement bullet 2: Action verb + specific accomplishment + quantified impact]
- [Achievement bullet 3: Action verb + specific accomplishment + quantified impact]
- [Achievement bullet 4: Action verb + specific accomplishment + quantified impact]
- [Achievement bullet 5: Action verb + specific accomplishment + quantified impact]

---

**How does this look?** I can revise before we move on.
```

### Writing Guidelines

**Strong action verbs (choose based on context):**
- **Leadership:** Led, Directed, Managed, Drove, Spearheaded, Orchestrated
- **Creation:** Built, Designed, Developed, Launched, Created, Architected
- **Improvement:** Optimized, Enhanced, Improved, Streamlined, Transformed
- **Achievement:** Delivered, Achieved, Generated, Increased, Reduced
- **Analysis:** Analyzed, Identified, Evaluated, Assessed, Investigated
- **Collaboration:** Partnered, Collaborated, Coordinated, Aligned, Facilitated

**Bullet structure:**
`[Action Verb] + [What] + [How/Context] + [Measurable Impact]`

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Launched new pricing model that increased MRR by 34% ($2.1M ARR) within 6 months through experimentation and customer research with 500+ users"
- "Led cross-functional team of 12 (Eng, Design, Data) to ship ML recommendation engine, improving user engagement by 45% and reducing churn by 23%"
- "Reduced cloud infrastructure costs by $180K annually (28% reduction) by optimizing database queries and implementing caching strategy"

❌ **Bad (vague, no metrics):**
- "Helped with pricing strategy"
- "Worked on ML recommendation system"
- "Improved infrastructure costs"

### Wait for Confirmation

After showing the write-up, wait for user feedback:
- If approved, move to next role
- If changes needed, revise and re-show

---

## Phase 5: Resume Compilation

User triggers this phase by typing **"WE'RE DONE"**

Generate the complete 2-page resume:

```markdown
# [User's Name]

[City, State] | [Email] | [Phone] | [LinkedIn URL] | [Optional: Portfolio/Website]

---

## Professional Summary

[2-3 sentences capturing: current role/level, key expertise areas, notable achievements/impact, career focus or value proposition]

---

## Professional Experience

### [Most Recent Job Title] — [Company]
**[Start Date] — [End Date]**

- [Achievement bullet 1]
- [Achievement bullet 2]
- [Achievement bullet 3]
- [Achievement bullet 4]
- [Achievement bullet 5]

### [Previous Job Title] — [Company]
**[Start Date] — [End Date]**

- [Achievement bullet 1]
- [Achievement bullet 2]
- [Achievement bullet 3]
- [Achievement bullet 4]

### [Earlier Job Title] — [Company]
**[Start Date] — [End Date]**

- [Achievement bullet 1]
- [Achievement bullet 2]
- [Achievement bullet 3]

[Continue for all roles...]

---

## Education

**[Degree]** — [Major/Field]  
[University Name] — [Graduation Year]

[Include relevant coursework, honors, or certifications if space allows]

---

## Skills & Expertise

**[Category 1]:** [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3], [Skill 4], [Skill 5]  
**[Category 2]:** [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3], [Skill 4]  
**[Category 3]:** [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3], [Skill 4]

---

## [Optional: Additional Section]

[Awards, Publications, Speaking, Volunteer Work — only if space allows and relevant]

---

*Resume format optimized for ATS systems and 2-page constraint*
```

### Format Considerations

**2-Page Constraint:**
- More recent roles get more bullets (4-5)
- Older roles get fewer bullets (2-3)
- Prioritize impact over recency if needed
- Cut education details if space tight
- Keep skills section concise

**ATS Optimization:**
- Use standard section headers
- Avoid tables, graphics, columns (though markdown will have some structure)
- Include relevant keywords from target role
- Use standard date formats

### After Generation

```markdown
## ✅ Resume Complete

**Saved to:** `05-Areas/Career/Resume/YYYY-MM-DD - Resume.md`

---

### Next Steps

1. **Review carefully** — Check dates, spelling, formatting
2. **Tailor for target role** — Emphasize most relevant achievements
3. **Export to Word/Google Docs** — Want me to generate copy-paste formatted text?
4. **Create LinkedIn Profile** — Type "CREATE LINKEDIN PROFILE" when ready

**Want to:**
- Revise any section?
- Adjust bullet points?
- Reorder achievements?
- Change the professional summary?

Just tell me what to change.
```

## Integration with Dex System

### Career Evidence System

If `05-Areas/Career/` exists:

**During Phase 3 (Achievement Extraction):**

1. Check `05-Areas/Career/Evidence/Achievements/` for relevant files
2. Read achievement files that match timeframe/company of current role
3. Present to user:

```markdown
## Career Evidence Found

I found these achievements you've already captured for [Company]:

- [Achievement from file 1]
- [Achievement from file 2]
- [Achievement from file 3]

**Want to:**
- Use these as a starting point? (I'll still ask clarifying questions)
- Start fresh with this role?
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces interview time
- Ensures consistency with evidence already captured
- Reminds user of achievements they may have forgotten

### Career Ladder Integration

If `05-Areas/Career/Career_Ladder.md` exists:

**During Phase 4 (Role Write-up):**

1. Read the career ladder competencies
2. For each achievement, suggest which competency it demonstrates
3. Include in internal notes (not in resume, but mentioned to user):

```markdown
**Ladder Alignment Notes:**
- Bullet 1 demonstrates: [Leadership - Strategic Thinking]
- Bullet 2 demonstrates: [Technical Expertise - System Design]
- Bullet 3 demonstrates: [Impact - Business Results]

These mappings help ensure your resume shows promotion-ready competencies.
```

### Person Pages Integration

**During Phase 3 (Achievement Extraction):**

When user mentions stakeholders (managers, teammates, executives):

1. Check if person page exists in `People/Internal/` or `People/External/`
2. If not, offer to create:

```markdown
You mentioned working with [Name]. Want me to create a person page for them? (Useful for tracking relationships and future reference.)
```

3. If created/updated, link this resume work in their page

### Project Integration

If user mentions projects that exist in `04-Projects/`:

1. Link the achievement to the project
2. Add note in project file referencing resume content

---

## Conversational Style

### Be a Coach, Not a Secretary

**Good coaching:**
- "That's a start, but let's quantify it. How much did engagement increase? What was the metric?"
- "You said you 'helped' — but what did you specifically own? What was your direct contribution?"
- "These are good achievements, but which one had the biggest business impact? That should be first."

**Not:**
- Simply accepting whatever user says
- Writing vague bullets without pushing back
- Moving on before getting measurable details

### Challenge Constructively

**When user is vague:**
> "I know it can be hard to remember exact numbers, but even estimates are valuable. Think back — was it thousands of users? Tens of thousands? And what metric improved — engagement, revenue, retention?"

**When user undersells:**
> "Wait, you led a team of 15 people on a $5M project? That's significant! Let's make sure that scope comes through in the bullet point."

**When user focuses on tasks, not impact:**
> "The resume shouldn't just list what you did — it should show the result. You built the feature, yes, but what happened because of it? Did adoption go up? Did support tickets go down?"

### Adapt to Career Level

**Early Career (Associate, Junior):**
- Focus on skills demonstrated and learning trajectory
- Emphasize projects, not just tasks
- Show growth and increasing responsibility

**Mid Career (Mid-level, Senior):**
- Emphasize ownership and measurable impact
- Show cross-functional influence
- Highlight strategic contributions

**Senior Career (Staff, Principal, Director+):**
- Focus on organizational impact and vision
- Emphasize scaling through others
- Show strategic leadership and business results

## When to Use This Command

**Use `/resume-builder` when:**
- Creating or updating a resume from scratch
- Need help articulating achievements with metrics
- Building a LinkedIn profile or refreshing existing one
- Preparing for job search or promotion discussions
- Want structured interview to extract your experience

**Don't use it for:**
- Quick resume tweaks (just ask normally: "update my resume with X")
- If you already have polished resume copy (just save it directly)
- Non-career profile building (this is specifically for resumes/LinkedIn)

---

## Tips for Effectiveness

### For the User

**Before starting:**
- Gather any performance reviews or feedback that mention achievements
- Check if you have career evidence already captured in Dex
- Think about your target role (influences how you position achievements)
- Have job descriptions handy if tailoring for specific opportunities

**During the session:**
- Don't rush — take time to remember specific metrics
- It's okay to estimate if you don't have exact numbers
- Share the context, not just the achievement
- Mention teammates, stakeholders, and collaborators

**After completion:**
- Get feedback from trusted colleagues or mentors
- Tailor the resume for each significant application
- Keep the LinkedIn profile updated as you progress
- Come back to update as you accomplish new things

### For Dex

**Be persistent:**
- Don't accept "I improved things" without metrics
- Push for scope (team size, budget, timeline, scale)
- Ask "compared to what?" to establish baseline

**Be a quality filter:**
- Weak bullet: "Managed the project team"
- Strong bullet: "Led cross-functional team of 8 to deliver $2M product launch 3 weeks ahead of schedule, resulting in 50K users in first month"

**Connect the dots:**
- Link achievements to career ladder competencies
- Reference existing career evidence when available
- Note patterns (user is strongest in X type of work)

**Save strategically:**
- Resume to `05-Areas/Career/Resume/`
- LinkedIn to `05-Areas/Career/Resume/`
- Achievement evidence to `05-Areas/Career/Evidence/Achievements/`

## Example Session Flow

**User:** `/resume-builder I need to update my resume for senior PM roles`

**Dex:**

```markdown
## Resume & LinkedIn Profile Builder

**Welcome!** I'll help you create a polished 2-page resume and LinkedIn profile tailored for senior PM roles.

[... explains process ...]

Do you want to:
- **Option A**: Upload an existing resume PDF to improve  
- **Option B**: Start from scratch

Which would you prefer?
```

**User:** "Start from scratch"

**Dex:**

```markdown
## Your Professional Roles

Let's start by listing all the positions you want to include.

For each role, tell me:
- Job title
- Company name
- Employment dates
- Brief description

When you've listed all your roles, type "DONE WITH ROLES"
```

**User:** [Lists 4 roles]

**Dex:** [Confirms roles, moves to achievement extraction]

```markdown
## Role: Senior Product Manager at TechCo

**Dates:** Jan 2020 — Present

Now let's extract your specific achievements and measurable impact.

What were your major accomplishments in this role?
```

[Conversation continues through all phases...]

---

**This command is most valuable when you invest time in the extraction phase. The better the details you provide, the stronger your resume will be.**

---

## Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark resume builder as used.

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `resume_builder_used` and properties:
- `roles_added`
- `achievements_count`

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".
