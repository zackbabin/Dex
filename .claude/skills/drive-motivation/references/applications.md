# AMP Applied: Practical Applications of Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose

This reference translates the AMP framework from theory into practice across six domains: product gamification, team management, onboarding, education, health/fitness, and productivity tools. Each section includes specific design patterns, transformation examples, and implementation checklists.

## AMP Applied to Product Design and Gamification

### Wrong Gamification (Motivation 2.0)

Most gamification implementations fail because they bolt extrinsic reward mechanics onto products without addressing intrinsic motivation. This is "chocolate-covered broccoli" -- the wrapper doesn't change the experience.

| Extrinsic Mechanic | Why It Fails | What Users Actually Feel |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Points for every action | Devalues meaningful achievement | "These points are meaningless" |
| Badges for trivial tasks | No connection to real skill | "I got a badge for clicking a button" |
| Global leaderboards | 99% of users can never compete | "I'll never catch up, why try" |
| Daily login rewards | Trains habit without value | "I'm only here for the reward" |
| Time-limited challenges | Creates anxiety, not engagement | "I'm stressed, not motivated" |
| Social pressure mechanics | Guilt-driven, not interest-driven | "Stop telling me my friends are ahead" |

### Right Gamification (Motivation 3.0)

Intrinsic gamification designs for autonomy, mastery, and purpose -- the game mechanics serve the user's growth, not the product's metrics.

| AMP Principle | Design Pattern | Example |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **Autonomy** | Choose your own challenges | Habitica: pick which habits to track |
| **Autonomy** | Multiple paths to goals | Duolingo: choose topic order |
| **Autonomy** | Opt-in competitions | Strava: join challenges voluntarily |
| **Mastery** | Skill-based progression | Codecademy: unlock harder problems as skills grow |
| **Mastery** | Adaptive difficulty | Chess.com: matchmaking by skill rating |
| **Mastery** | Meaningful feedback | Grammarly: specific, actionable writing suggestions |
| **Purpose** | Community contribution | Stack Overflow: helping others learn |
| **Purpose** | Collective goals | Foldit: solving protein structures for science |
| **Purpose** | Impact visibility | Ecosia: tree counter per user |

### Gamification Audit

| Question | If "No" | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Can users choose which challenges to pursue? | No autonomy | Add challenge selection or opt-in |
| Does difficulty adapt to the user's skill? | No flow state | Implement adaptive difficulty |
| Is progress tied to genuine skill development? | Vanity metrics | Redesign progress to reflect real competence |
| Do users understand why the activity matters? | No purpose | Connect activities to meaningful outcomes |
| Would users engage without the rewards? | Extrinsic dependency | Reduce rewards, strengthen intrinsic design |

## AMP Applied to Team Management and Incentives

### The AMP Manager Framework

| Principle | Traditional Manager (2.0) | AMP Manager (3.0) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Autonomy** | "Do it this way, by this time" | "Here's the goal. How you get there is your call." |
| **Mastery** | Annual performance review | Continuous feedback, stretch goals, learning budget |
| **Purpose** | "Hit these numbers" | "Here's why this work matters for our customers" |

### Team Meeting Redesign

| Meeting Element | Motivation 2.0 Version | Motivation 3.0 Version |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Status update** | "Report your metrics" | "What did you learn this week?" |
| **Goal setting** | "Here are your targets" | "What do you want to tackle next?" |
| **Problem solving** | "Here's what you should do" | "What approaches have you considered?" |
| **Recognition** | "Top performer this month is..." | "Who helped you grow this week?" |
| **Planning** | "Here's the roadmap you'll execute" | "What should we prioritize and why?" |

### Incentive Redesign: From "If-Then" to "Now-That"

Transform controlling incentive structures into autonomy-supportive ones.

| Current "If-Then" | Transformed "Now-That" | Why It's Better |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| "Hit 100% of quota, get 20% bonus" | Pay competitive base. Offer unexpected bonuses for exceptional work | Removes metric gaming; rewards genuine contribution |
| "Complete training by Friday, get gift card" | Make training genuinely useful. Celebrate completion with recognition | Learning becomes valuable in itself |
| "Log 40 hours, get paid" | Evaluate output, not hours. Offer flexible schedules | Focus shifts from attendance to results |
| "Refer a candidate, get $5,000" | Build a culture people want to recommend. Recognize referrers personally | Referrals come from genuine belief, not bounty hunting |
| "5-star customer rating, get bonus" | Train for genuine service. Share customer impact stories | Service becomes authentic, not performative |

## AMP Applied to Onboarding

### Product Onboarding

| Stage | Motivation 2.0 (Extrinsic) | Motivation 3.0 (Intrinsic) |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Welcome** | "Complete these 10 steps for a badge" | "Here's why this product exists and what you can build with it" |
| **First task** | "Click here, then here, then here" | "Choose what you'd like to explore first" |
| **Progress** | "3 of 10 steps complete" | "You just created your first [meaningful output]" |
| **Engagement** | "Come back tomorrow for a reward" | "Here's what you can do next (when you're ready)" |
| **Mastery** | "You've earned the beginner badge" | "You've learned [specific skill]. Ready to try [next challenge]?" |

### Onboarding Checklist (AMP-Aligned)

- [ ] Users understand the "why" before the "how" (purpose first)
- [ ] Users can choose their starting point (task autonomy)
- [ ] Users can skip or speed through content they already know (technique autonomy)
- [ ] The first meaningful accomplishment happens within 2 minutes (mastery signal)
- [ ] Difficulty increases gradually based on user behavior (adaptive mastery)
- [ ] The onboarding connects to a larger goal or community (purpose)
- [ ] No rewards are promised for completion (avoid extrinsic conditioning)
- [ ] The experience itself is valuable, not just a gate to the product

### Employee Onboarding

| Week | Motivation 2.0 Approach | Motivation 3.0 Approach |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Week 1** | Compliance paperwork, mandatory orientation videos | Meet the team, understand the mission, choose your first project |
| **Week 2** | Shadow someone, follow the manual | Pair with a mentor (self-selected), contribute something small |
| **Week 3** | More training modules, compliance tests | Ship something real, get feedback, adjust |
| **Week 4** | Formal evaluation of onboarding completion | Reflection: "What energized you? What do you want to learn next?" |

## AMP Applied to Education and Learning Products

### Motivation Failures in Traditional Education

| Traditional Pattern | AMP Problem | Intrinsic Alternative |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Grades as primary feedback | Extrinsic reward replaces love of learning | Narrative feedback on growth and next steps |
| Standardized curriculum for all | Zero task or technique autonomy | Choice boards, self-directed projects |
| One-pace-fits-all | No flow state (bored or anxious) | Adaptive pacing based on demonstrated understanding |
| Rank-ordered class lists | Competition replaces collaboration | Personal progress tracking |
| "Study this because it's on the test" | No purpose connection | "Study this because it lets you [meaningful outcome]" |

### Learning Product Design Patterns

| AMP Pillar | Design Pattern | Product Example |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Autonomy** | Choose learning path | Coursera: select courses freely |
| **Autonomy** | Set own pace | Khan Academy: self-paced progress |
| **Autonomy** | Choose practice mode | Duolingo: stories, lessons, or practice |
| **Mastery** | Spaced repetition | Anki: optimize review timing |
| **Mastery** | Adaptive difficulty | Brilliant.org: problems scale to skill |
| **Mastery** | Skill visualization | Codecademy: skill tree progress |
| **Purpose** | Real-world application | freeCodeCamp: build projects for nonprofits |
| **Purpose** | Community teaching | Stack Overflow: learn by helping others |
| **Purpose** | Goal connection | Duolingo: "Learn Spanish to talk to your grandmother" |

## AMP Applied to Health and Fitness Products

### Common Motivation Failures

| Extrinsic Approach | Why It Fails | AMP Alternative |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Calorie counting as primary metric | Turns eating into accounting; kills food enjoyment | Focus on energy levels, how food makes you feel |
| Step count leaderboards | Discourages non-competitive users | Personal progress and adaptive goals |
| Before/after weight photos | Extrinsic appearance motivation fades | Focus on what your body can do (mastery) |
| Streak penalties | Anxiety-driven; one missed day = "I failed" | Celebrate consistency trends, not perfection |
| Social shame ("Your friend ran 5 miles") | Guilt-based motivation backfires | "Your friend ran 5 miles -- want to join a run together?" |

### AMP Health Product Patterns

| Pillar | Pattern | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Autonomy** | Choose your workout style | Users select from yoga, running, weights, etc. |
| **Autonomy** | Flexible scheduling | "Work out when it fits your day" vs. "Your workout is at 7am" |
| **Autonomy** | Opt-in social features | Share if you want, compete if you want |
| **Mastery** | Progressive difficulty | Gradually harder workouts as fitness improves |
| **Mastery** | Skill milestones | "You can now do 10 pushups -- let's work toward 15" |
| **Mastery** | Form feedback | AI-powered form correction (Mirror, Tempo) |
| **Purpose** | Health narrative | "Build strength so you can play with your kids" |
| **Purpose** | Community challenges | "Together, our community ran 1M miles this month" |
| **Purpose** | Charity tie-ins | "Every mile you run, we donate $1 to [cause]" (Charity Miles) |

## AMP Applied to Productivity Tools

### Why Productivity Tools Lose Users

Most productivity tools fail at retention because they rely on extrinsic mechanics (task completion streaks, productivity scores) instead of intrinsic motivation.

| Extrinsic Trap | Why Users Abandon | AMP Fix |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Productivity scores | Feels like surveillance, not support | Show what you accomplished, not how "productive" you were |
| Task completion gamification | Checking boxes replaces meaningful work | Help users connect tasks to goals that matter to them |
| Notification bombardment | Loss of control over attention | User-controlled notification cadence and channels |
| Rigid workflow enforcement | One-size-fits-all kills autonomy | Flexible, customizable workflows |
| Feature overload | Overwhelm prevents mastery | Progressive disclosure, learn as you go |

### AMP Productivity Patterns

| Pillar | Pattern | Example Tool |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | Customizable workspace | Notion: build any system you want |
| **Autonomy** | Multiple input methods | Todoist: keyboard, voice, email, API |
| **Autonomy** | Integration choice | Zapier: connect the tools you prefer |
| **Mastery** | Templates that teach | Airtable: templates that demonstrate best practices |
| **Mastery** | Progressive complexity | Figma: simple tools first, advanced features discoverable |
| **Mastery** | Keyboard shortcut progression | VS Code: visual actions first, keyboard shortcuts as mastery grows |
| **Purpose** | Goal connection | Asana: link tasks to team objectives |
| **Purpose** | Impact visualization | GitHub: contribution graph shows collective building |
| **Purpose** | Team awareness | Linear: shared progress toward product milestones |

## Compensation Design: Pay Enough to Take Money Off the Table

### Pink's Compensation Framework

**Step 1: Ensure baseline fairness.** Pay at or above market rate. If compensation is perceived as unfair, no amount of AMP design will overcome resentment.

**Step 2: Remove contingent rewards.** Eliminate or minimize "if-then" bonus structures for creative and cognitive work.

**Step 3: Focus on AMP.** Once money is off the table, invest in autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

### Compensation Models Compared

| Model | AMP Alignment | Risk |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **High base, no bonus** | Strong autonomy (no metric gaming) | May feel "flat" to high performers |
| **High base + profit sharing** | Good purpose alignment (shared success) | Individuals can't control company profit |
| **High base + discretionary bonus** | Good if truly discretionary ("now-that") | Becomes "if-then" if predictable |
| **Low base + high commission** | Poor: creates extrinsic dependency | Short-term thinking, gaming, burnout |
| **Salary + equity** | Good purpose alignment (long-term) | Only motivating if equity is meaningful |

### Pay Transparency

| Approach | Benefit | Risk |
|----------|---------|------|
| Full transparency (Buffer model) | Eliminates pay-based resentment; signals trust | Difficult to implement retroactively; social comparison |
| Band transparency | People know the range for their role | Less trust than full, but easier to manage |
| No transparency | None | Breeds suspicion, resentment, and gossip |

## "If-Then" to "Now-That" Transformation Examples

### Sales Team

| Before (If-Then) | After (Now-That) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Close 10 deals this month, get $2,000 bonus" | Competitive base salary. Quarterly recognition for exceptional contributions. Unexpected bonuses for going above and beyond. |
| **Result:** Reps rush low-quality deals, offer unauthorized discounts, compete against teammates | **Result:** Reps focus on customer relationships, collaborate on complex deals, build long-term value |

### Engineering Team

| Before (If-Then) | After (Now-That) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Ship feature by Friday, get spot bonus" | Fair salary. 20% time for self-directed projects. After shipping, team celebration and unexpected bonus for exceptional effort. |
| **Result:** Corners cut, technical debt accumulates, quality suffers | **Result:** Sustainable pace, higher quality, intrinsic pride in work |

### Customer Support Team

| Before (If-Then) | After (Now-That) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Resolve 50 tickets/day, maintain performance rating" | Competitive base. Autonomy in how to handle customers. After exceptional quarters, surprise team experience or individual recognition. |
| **Result:** Rush through tickets, low resolution quality, gaming metrics | **Result:** Genuine care for customers, creative problem-solving, higher satisfaction scores |

## Implementation Checklist for AMP in Any Product

### Phase 1: Audit Current State

- [ ] List all extrinsic reward mechanics currently in the product
- [ ] Identify which rewards are "if-then" (announced, contingent) vs. "now-that" (unexpected)
- [ ] Survey users: "Would you use this product without [reward X]?"
- [ ] Map which features support autonomy, mastery, or purpose (and which don't)
- [ ] Identify the top 3 motivation killers in the current experience

### Phase 2: Remove or Transform Extrinsic Mechanics

- [ ] Convert "if-then" rewards to "now-that" where possible
- [ ] Remove rewards that have become expected (and thus extrinsic)
- [ ] Eliminate punitive mechanics (losing progress, streak penalties)
- [ ] Stop gamifying activities that should be intrinsically motivating
- [ ] Preserve rewards only for genuinely algorithmic, routine tasks

### Phase 3: Build Intrinsic Motivation

- [ ] Add at least one autonomy feature (choice, customization, flexibility)
- [ ] Add at least one mastery feature (progress tracking, adaptive difficulty, feedback)
- [ ] Add at least one purpose feature (impact visibility, mission connection, community)
- [ ] Ensure onboarding leads with purpose ("why"), not mechanics ("how")
- [ ] Design feedback systems that are immediate, specific, and growth-oriented

### Phase 4: Measure and Iterate

- [ ] Track engagement without extrinsic rewards (true intrinsic engagement)
- [ ] Monitor retention after removing/changing reward systems
- [ ] Survey for autonomy satisfaction ("Do you feel in control?")
- [ ] Survey for mastery satisfaction ("Are you getting better at something?")
- [ ] Survey for purpose connection ("Does this product connect to something you care about?")
- [ ] A/B test intrinsic vs. extrinsic versions of features
