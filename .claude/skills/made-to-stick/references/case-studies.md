# Case Studies: Sticky Ideas Analyzed Through the SUCCESs Framework

The best way to understand the SUCCESs framework is to see it in action. This reference analyzes real-world sticky ideas — messages, campaigns, stories, and legends that have endured for years or decades. Each case study breaks down which principles made the idea stick and what lessons you can extract for your own communication.

## Case Study 1: JFK's Moonshot Speech (1961)

### The Idea

"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth."

### Why It Stuck

This single sentence mobilized an entire nation, directed billions of dollars in spending, and aligned hundreds of thousands of engineers, scientists, and administrators toward one goal. Fifty years later, "moonshot" is a synonym for ambitious goals.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | One goal. Not "advance our space capabilities" — land a man on the moon. Commander's Intent at its purest. |
| **Unexpected** | Yes | In 1961, the U.S. was behind the Soviet Union in space. Committing to the moon was audaciously counterintuitive. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | "Landing a man on the moon and returning him safely." Not "space exploration leadership." You can picture a person standing on the moon. |
| **Credible** | Yes | The President of the United States, speaking before Congress, staking his presidency on the claim. |
| **Emotional** | Yes | National pride, Cold War urgency, the spirit of exploration. "We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard." |
| **Stories** | Partial | The speech itself was not a story, but it launched a decade of stories — every mission, every astronaut, every triumph and failure became part of the narrative. |

### Lessons

- A concrete deadline ("before this decade is out") makes an abstract goal tangible
- The best Commander's Intent generates thousands of decisions without further guidance
- Audacious goals can be simple if they are concrete enough to picture

## Case Study 2: Subway's Jared Diet Story

### The Idea

Jared Fogle, a college student weighing 425 pounds, lost 245 pounds by eating Subway sandwiches twice a day for a year.

### Why It Stuck

Subway's advertising agency initially rejected the story. Too simple, too weird, too risky. But a local franchise owner championed it, and the campaign ran for over a decade, contributing to Subway becoming the largest restaurant chain in the world by number of locations.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | The core message is effortless: eat Subway, lose weight. No calorie counting, no complex diet plans. |
| **Unexpected** | Yes | Fast food that helps you lose weight? That is a direct violation of expectations about fast food. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | 425 pounds to 180 pounds. Pants with a 60-inch waist held up as a prop. Two specific sandwiches (6-inch turkey, 12-inch veggie). |
| **Credible** | Yes | Anti-authority credibility. Jared was not a doctor or a nutritionist — he was a regular guy who did it himself. His old pants were the testable credential. |
| **Emotional** | Yes | Jared's transformation was deeply personal. Anyone who has struggled with weight could identify with him. |
| **Stories** | Yes | This IS a story. Character (Jared, a struggling college student), problem (extreme obesity), journey (ate Subway for a year), outcome (lost 245 pounds, got his life back). |

### Lessons

- Anti-authorities (regular people) are more persuasive than experts for personal transformation stories
- Concrete proof props (the old pants) are more memorable than any statistic
- Stories that seem too simple or too good often are the stickiest — if they are true
- The Sinatra Test: if Subway could help someone lose 245 pounds, it can probably help you eat healthier

## Case Study 3: "Don't Mess with Texas" Anti-Littering Campaign

### The Idea

A public anti-littering campaign that reframed littering as a violation of Texas identity rather than a civic duty.

### Why It Stuck

Previous anti-littering campaigns in Texas used guilt and environmental messaging. They failed completely with the target demographic: young men aged 18-35 who drove pickup trucks and did not respond to guilt. "Don't Mess with Texas" reduced littering by 72% in the first year.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | Four words. One message. Do not litter — because you are Texan. |
| **Unexpected** | Yes | An anti-littering campaign that never mentions the environment, guilt, or civic responsibility. Instead, it appeals to state pride. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | "Mess with" is vivid and physical. You can picture someone throwing trash on the ground — and picture a Texan being angry about it. |
| **Credible** | Yes | Endorsed by Texas celebrities (Dallas Cowboys players, Willie Nelson, Stevie Ray Vaughan). But the real credibility was identity-based: Texans trust other Texans. |
| **Emotional** | Yes | Pure identity appeal. Not "you should not litter" but "Texans do not litter." It tapped into fierce state pride. |
| **Stories** | Partial | The campaign featured Texas icons in TV spots, each telling a mini-story about Texas pride. |

### Lessons

- Identity-based messaging ("what would someone like me do?") is more powerful than rational argument
- Understanding your audience's identity is more important than understanding their logic
- The best campaigns do not tell people what to do — they tell people who they are
- Simple, memorable language becomes a cultural artifact: "Don't Mess with Texas" is now on license plates, t-shirts, and bumper stickers decades later

## Case Study 4: The Nordstrom Tire Refund Legend

### The Idea

A customer walked into a Nordstrom store and asked to return a set of tires. Nordstrom does not sell tires. The employee gave the customer a full refund anyway.

### Why It Stuck

This story has been told and retold inside and outside Nordstrom for decades. It may or may not be literally true, but it perfectly encapsulates Nordstrom's commitment to customer service. It is a generative story — it tells every Nordstrom employee how to behave in ambiguous situations.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | The core message is crystal clear: at Nordstrom, the customer is always right. Always. No exceptions. |
| **Unexpected** | Yes | Refunding tires at a store that does not sell tires is absurd. That absurdity is what makes it memorable. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | Tires. Not "a product." Not "an item." Tires. You can see them, smell the rubber, picture the confused employee and the determined customer. |
| **Credible** | Partial | The story's credibility comes from its specificity and from Nordstrom's real reputation for service. But the literal truth is debated. |
| **Emotional** | Yes | It inspires both admiration (what a company!) and aspiration (I want to work/shop there). |
| **Stories** | Yes | This is a pure story. Character (employee + customer), problem (unreasonable request), resolution (do it anyway), outcome (legendary service reputation). |

### Lessons

- Stories do not need to be literally true to be organizationally true — they encode values
- The more extreme the example, the stronger the behavioral guidance it provides
- One concrete story is worth a thousand pages of company values documents
- Generative stories teach people what to do in situations they have never encountered

## Case Study 5: The Kidney Heist Urban Legend

### The Idea

A man wakes up in a bathtub full of ice in a hotel room. A note tells him to call 911 immediately. He discovers that one of his kidneys has been surgically removed.

### Why It Stuck

This story has circulated in various forms since the 1990s across dozens of countries. It has never been verified as true. Yet it persists because it is perfectly engineered — not by design, but by the evolutionary pressure of retelling. Versions that are stickier survive; versions that are not die out.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | Core message: be careful with strangers, especially when traveling. One idea, instantly graspable. |
| **Unexpected** | Yes | Waking up in a bathtub full of ice with a kidney missing is a shocking violation of expectations about what happens when you go to a hotel. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | Bathtub. Ice. A note. A phone. A scar. Every element is viscerally tangible. |
| **Credible** | Partial | The story is credible because of its vivid details (which details imply truth) and because it is told as a friend-of-a-friend account. |
| **Emotional** | Yes | Fear, vulnerability, violation. It hits primal safety concerns. |
| **Stories** | Yes | Pure narrative: a character, a setup, a catastrophic event, a grim discovery. |

### Lessons

- Ideas that use all six principles tend to survive across time and cultures — even without intentional design
- Urban legends are naturally selected for stickiness: the versions that spread best are the versions that survive
- Concrete sensory details (the ice, the bathtub, the note) are what make the story retellable
- Emotional ideas spread faster than rational ones — fear is one of the most powerful drivers

## Case Study 6: "Names, Names, Names" — Local Newspaper Motto

### The Idea

Horace Greeley, a local newspaper editor, told his reporters that the secret to a successful local paper was "names, names, names" — publish as many local names as possible.

### Why It Stuck

This three-word motto guided decades of editorial decisions. When reporters wondered whether to cover a story, what angle to take, or what photo to run, the answer was always: prioritize local names. It was the Commander's Intent for an entire organization.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | Three words. One principle. Infinitely generative. |
| **Unexpected** | Partial | For journalists trained to chase "big" stories, the idea that names matter more than events was counterintuitive. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | "Names" is concrete. Not "community engagement" or "local relevance." Names. You can count them. |
| **Credible** | Yes | Came from a successful editor with a proven track record. The paper's popularity was the proof. |
| **Emotional** | Partial | People love seeing their names in print. The motto tapped into that universal human desire for recognition. |
| **Stories** | No | This is not a story — it is a generative principle. But it generated thousands of stories. |

### Lessons

- A generative metaphor (one that guides behavior in novel situations) is the most powerful form of simplicity
- The best Commander's Intent fits in three words
- Concrete instructions ("names") beat abstract goals ("community relevance") every time
- If your team needs a manual to interpret your strategy, your strategy is not simple enough

## Case Study 7: Apple's "1,000 Songs in Your Pocket"

### The Idea

When Apple launched the iPod in 2001, Steve Jobs described it as "1,000 songs in your pocket."

### Why It Stuck

Competing MP3 players advertised storage capacity in megabytes and gigabytes. Nobody knew what "5 GB of storage" meant in practical terms. Jobs translated the technical specification into a concrete, personal outcome. It became one of the most memorable product taglines in history.

### SUCCESs Analysis

| Principle | Present? | How It Was Used |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Yes | Six words. One idea. No technical jargon. |
| **Unexpected** | Yes | In 2001, carrying 1,000 songs was genuinely surprising. Music collections lived on shelves and in CD binders, not in pockets. |
| **Concrete** | Yes | "1,000 songs" — you can picture your music library. "In your pocket" — you can feel it. Two concrete images in six words. |
| **Credible** | Yes | It was Steve Jobs on stage with the physical product. You could hold it. |
| **Emotional** | Yes | Freedom, joy, personal identity. Your music — all of it — with you everywhere. Music is deeply emotional to most people. |
| **Stories** | Partial | Not a narrative, but it implies a story: imagine walking down the street with your entire music collection. |

### Lessons

- Translating technical specs into human outcomes is one of the most powerful applications of concreteness
- "5 GB" means nothing. "1,000 songs" means everything. Same fact, different stickiness.
- The best product descriptions tell you what the product does for you, not what it is
- Physical metaphors ("in your pocket") ground abstract benefits in the body
- Competitors who advertise specs lose to competitors who advertise outcomes

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

Analyzing these cases together reveals patterns that apply to any sticky idea:

### Pattern 1: Concreteness Is Non-Negotiable

Every single case study uses concrete language. This is not a coincidence. Abstraction is the most common reason ideas fail to stick. Tires, bathtubs, the moon, 1,000 songs — these are images that lodge in memory.

### Pattern 2: Emotional Resonance Drives Sharing

Ideas spread when they make people feel something. Fear (kidney heist), pride (Don't Mess with Texas), inspiration (JFK), aspiration (Jared), delight (iPod). The feeling does not need to be positive — it needs to be strong.

### Pattern 3: Simple Does Not Mean Short

JFK's moonshot sentence is long. But it has one idea. Simplicity is about the number of core ideas, not the number of words.

### Pattern 4: Stories Are the Ultimate Vehicle

Five of the seven case studies are primarily stories. Stories combine all other principles naturally: they require characters (concrete), events (unexpected), outcomes (credible), and emotions (emotional). If you can only use one principle, use stories.

### Pattern 5: Stickiness Is Testable

You can predict stickiness by auditing against the SUCCESs framework. Ideas that score high on multiple principles tend to spread and endure. Ideas that rely on only one principle tend to fade.

## How to Reverse-Engineer Stickiness

When you encounter a message, campaign, or idea that sticks with you, run this analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Core Message

What is the single idea being communicated? Write it in one sentence.

### Step 2: Run the SUCCESs Audit

| Principle | Is It Present? | How Is It Implemented? |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Simple | | |
| Unexpected | | |
| Concrete | | |
| Credible | | |
| Emotional | | |
| Stories | | |

### Step 3: Find the Dominant Principle

Which principle does the heaviest lifting? That is the idea's "stickiness engine."

### Step 4: Identify Transferable Techniques

What specific technique can you borrow for your own communication?

| Case Study | Transferable Technique |
|-----------|----------------------|
| JFK Moonshot | Set a concrete, time-bound goal that generates decisions |
| Subway Jared | Use an anti-authority with a dramatic personal transformation |
| Don't Mess with Texas | Frame behavior as identity, not obligation |
| Nordstrom Tires | Tell an extreme example that teaches the principle |
| Kidney Heist | Use vivid sensory details to make any scenario feel real |
| Names Names Names | Create a generative metaphor that guides behavior |
| 1,000 Songs | Translate technical specs into human, emotional outcomes |

### Step 5: Apply to Your Context

Take the technique and apply it directly:

- **Your moonshot:** "We will [specific, concrete outcome] by [date]"
- **Your Jared:** "Meet [real person] who [dramatic transformation using your product]"
- **Your identity frame:** "[Your audience identity] does not [undesirable behavior]"
- **Your Nordstrom story:** "One time, we [extreme example of your core value]"
- **Your vivid details:** "On [specific day], at [specific place], [specific thing happened]"
- **Your motto:** "[Three words] that guide every decision"
- **Your pocket:** "[Number] [things your audience cares about] in [where they want it]"

## Stickiness Scoring Exercise

Take your current most important message and score it:

| Principle | Score (0-10) | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Simple | | |
| Unexpected | | |
| Concrete | | |
| Credible | | |
| Emotional | | |
| Stories | | |
| **Total** | **/60** | |

- **45-60:** Extremely sticky. This message will endure.
- **30-44:** Strong. A few improvements could make it exceptional.
- **15-29:** Average. Significant rework needed on weak principles.
- **Below 15:** Will not stick. Fundamental reimagining required.

Now look at your lowest-scoring principle. That is where the biggest improvement opportunity lies. Raise your weakest principle by even 3 points and the entire message gets stronger.
