# Concrete: Making Ideas Tangible and Memorable

Abstraction is the enemy of memory. The more abstract your language, the fewer hooks your audience has to hold onto. Concrete ideas stick because they engage the senses, create mental images, and connect to real experience. This reference is a deep dive into making any idea — no matter how complex or intangible — concrete enough to remember and act on.

## The Velcro Theory of Memory

Think of memory as Velcro. One side has thousands of tiny hooks. The other side has thousands of tiny loops. The more hooks and loops that connect, the stronger the bond.

Abstract ideas are smooth — they have very few hooks. Concrete ideas are covered in hooks: sensory details, specific images, tangible objects, real people, particular moments.

| Abstract (Smooth) | Concrete (Velcro) | Why It Sticks |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "Vehicle" | "A red 1967 Mustang convertible" | You can see it, hear the engine, feel the wind |
| "Improve customer satisfaction" | "Every customer gets a handwritten thank-you note within 24 hours" | You can picture someone writing the note |
| "Increase efficiency" | "Cut the report from 47 clicks to 3" | You can count the clicks |
| "Better communication" | "Every team member posts a 2-sentence daily update by 9am" | You can do it or not do it — it is binary |
| "Drive growth" | "Add 200 paying customers every month" | You can track it on a chart |

### Why This Matters for Communication

When you say "vehicle," every person in the room pictures a different thing. One sees a truck, another a sedan, another a motorcycle. When you say "red 1967 Mustang convertible," everyone sees the same thing. Concrete language creates shared understanding. Abstract language creates the illusion of shared understanding.

## Abstract vs. Concrete: Transformation Techniques

### Technique 1: Replace Categories with Examples

Every time you use a category word, ask: "Can I replace this with a specific example?"

| Category (Abstract) | Specific Example (Concrete) |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| "Businesses of all sizes" | "A 3-person design studio and a 500-person logistics company" |
| "Various industries" | "Hospital ERs, fast-food chains, and law firms" |
| "Multiple use cases" | "Tracking sales calls, onboarding new hires, and debugging outages" |
| "Key stakeholders" | "The VP of Engineering, the head of recruiting, and the CFO" |
| "Significant improvement" | "Went from 4 missed deadlines per quarter to zero" |

### Technique 2: Translate Features into Sensory Outcomes

Features are abstract capabilities. Sensory outcomes are what the user sees, hears, or feels when the feature works.

| Feature (Abstract) | Sensory Outcome (Concrete) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| "Real-time collaboration" | "You see your teammate's cursor moving across the document as they type" |
| "Automated reporting" | "Every Monday at 8am, a PDF lands in your inbox with last week's numbers" |
| "Intelligent search" | "Type 'that email from Sarah about the budget' and it finds the exact thread" |
| "Seamless integration" | "Click 'Connect Salesforce' and your pipeline appears in 30 seconds" |
| "Advanced analytics" | "A red dot appears next to any customer who is likely to churn this month" |

### Technique 3: Convert Percentages to Real Numbers

Percentages feel abstract. Real numbers tied to real things feel concrete.

| Percentage (Abstract) | Real Number (Concrete) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "Save 30% of your time" | "Get back 12 hours every week — that is a whole day and a half" |
| "Reduce errors by 85%" | "Go from 17 bugs per release to 2 or 3" |
| "40% faster deployment" | "Deploy in 6 minutes instead of 10 — before your coffee gets cold" |
| "95% uptime" | "Down for 18 days a year — that is almost 3 full work weeks" |
| "99.9% uptime" | "Down for 8 hours a year — roughly one workday" |

### Technique 4: Add Time, Place, and Person

Abstractions float in a void. Concrete ideas are anchored to a specific time, place, and person.

**Abstract:**
> "Our platform improves team productivity."

**Concrete (with time, place, and person):**
> "Last Tuesday at 2pm, the engineering team at Acme Corp used our platform to resolve a production incident in 11 minutes. The same type of incident used to take them 3 hours."

## Sensory Language: Engaging the Five Senses

The brain processes sensory information differently from abstract information. Sensory details activate the same brain regions as actual experience. When you read about the smell of fresh bread, your olfactory cortex activates.

### Applying Sensory Language to Product Messaging

| Sense | Abstract Version | Sensory Version |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Sight** | "Beautiful dashboard" | "A clean white screen with three colored bars — green means you are on track" |
| **Sound** | "Get notified instantly" | "Your phone buzzes the moment a deal closes" |
| **Touch** | "Easy to use" | "Drag a card from one column to the next — that is it" |
| **Taste/Smell** | "Fresh ingredients" | "Tomatoes picked this morning, basil that still smells like the garden" |
| **Motion** | "Fast loading" | "Pages snap into place — no spinning wheels, no waiting" |

### The Sensory Language Audit

Go through your current messaging and highlight every abstract word. Then, for each one, ask: "Can the audience see it, hear it, touch it, or feel it?" If not, rewrite.

**Common abstract words that need sensory replacements:**

| Abstract Word | Ask Yourself | Possible Replacement |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| "Efficient" | What does efficient look like? | "Finishes in 3 clicks" |
| "Powerful" | What does power look like here? | "Processes 1 million rows in under a second" |
| "Innovative" | What is the innovation? Show it. | "The first tool that lets you edit video by editing text" |
| "Seamless" | What would seams look like? | "No login screens, no copy-pasting, no switching tabs" |
| "Robust" | What survives that others don't? | "Handles Black Friday traffic without a single error" |

## Specific Numbers vs. Vague Claims

Vague claims feel like marketing. Specific numbers feel like truth.

### The Specificity Principle

The more specific a number, the more believable it is — even if the audience does not verify it. "We have helped 2,347 companies" is more believable than "We have helped thousands of companies," even though both could be equally true or false.

| Vague Claim | Specific Claim | Why It Works |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| "Thousands of customers" | "2,347 customers across 41 countries" | Specificity implies careful tracking |
| "Saves you hours" | "Saves 11.4 hours per week on average" | Decimal point implies measurement |
| "Fast support" | "Average response time: 47 seconds" | Odd number implies real data |
| "Lots of integrations" | "Connects to 143 tools including Slack, Salesforce, and HubSpot" | Number + examples = concrete |
| "Trusted by leading companies" | "Used by 7 of the Fortune 10" | Precise fraction implies verifiable |

### When to Use Round Numbers vs. Precise Numbers

- **Round numbers** for vision and scale: "We want to help 1 million small businesses"
- **Precise numbers** for credibility and proof: "We have helped 14,832 small businesses so far"
- **Never use round numbers** when claiming results: "Saves about 50%" feels like a guess. "Saves 47%" feels like a measurement.

## Demonstrations and Before/After Comparisons

### The Power of Demonstration

A demonstration is worth a thousand bullet points. When someone can see the product working with real data on a real problem, abstraction evaporates.

**Rules for effective demonstrations:**

1. **Use real data** — never "Lorem ipsum" or fake company names
2. **Solve a real problem** — not a contrived example
3. **Show the pain first** — demonstrate the old way before the new way
4. **Time it** — "Watch: this takes 8 seconds" is more concrete than "It's fast"
5. **Let the audience drive** — interactive demos beat scripted walkthroughs

### Before/After Comparison Template

| Dimension | Before (Without Product) | After (With Product) |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Time spent** | [Specific hours/minutes] | [Specific hours/minutes] |
| **Steps required** | [Specific number of steps] | [Specific number of steps] |
| **Error rate** | [Specific frequency] | [Specific frequency] |
| **People involved** | [Specific roles/count] | [Specific roles/count] |
| **Tools used** | [List specific tools] | [Just your tool] |
| **Emotional state** | [Concrete frustration] | [Concrete relief] |

### Example Before/After

| Dimension | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Time** | 4 hours every Friday afternoon | 10 minutes on Monday morning |
| **Steps** | Export from 3 tools, paste into Excel, format, email | Click "Generate" and it sends itself |
| **Errors** | Wrong numbers at least once a month | Automated = zero manual errors |
| **People** | Analyst + manager + reviewer | Nobody (it's automated) |
| **Tools** | Salesforce, Google Analytics, Excel, Gmail | Just our dashboard |
| **Feeling** | "Friday afternoons are the worst" | "I forgot reports were even a thing" |

## Application Across Contexts

### Product Messaging

| Abstract Product Message | Concrete Product Message |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| "Streamline your workflow" | "Cut 23 steps down to 5. Here is what goes away: [list]" |
| "Enterprise-ready security" | "Your data is encrypted, stored in Frankfurt, and we passed a SOC 2 audit last month" |
| "Actionable insights" | "Every morning you see a list of the 3 customers most likely to upgrade this week" |

### Presentations

| Abstract Slide | Concrete Slide |
|---------------|----------------|
| "We saw significant growth in Q3" | "Q3: 847 new customers, $2.1M in new ARR, 3 enterprise logos" |
| "Our users love the product" | "[Screenshot of actual user message]: 'This tool literally saved my job'" |
| "We are expanding into new markets" | "We signed our first customer in Tokyo last Tuesday. Here is their story." |

### Documentation and Help Content

| Abstract Documentation | Concrete Documentation |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| "Configure your settings as needed" | "Click Settings > Notifications > toggle 'Email alerts' to ON" |
| "Integrate with your existing tools" | "Step 1: Open Slack. Step 2: Type /connect. Step 3: Paste your API key." |
| "Customize the dashboard" | "Drag the Revenue widget to the top-left corner. It snaps into place." |

## Exercises: Make Any Abstract Idea Concrete

### Exercise 1: The Camera Test

Read your message and ask: "Could a camera record this?" If a filmmaker cannot point a camera at it and capture it, the language is too abstract.

- "Improve team alignment" — A camera cannot film "alignment." Rewrite.
- "Every Monday at 9am, the team spends 15 minutes reviewing the same dashboard together" — A camera can film this.

### Exercise 2: The Specificity Ladder

Take an abstract statement and make it more specific in five steps:

1. "We help companies" (most abstract)
2. "We help mid-size SaaS companies"
3. "We help mid-size SaaS companies reduce churn"
4. "We help mid-size SaaS companies reduce churn by identifying at-risk accounts"
5. "We send you a Slack alert when a customer has not logged in for 7 days, with a suggested re-engagement email ready to send" (most concrete)

### Exercise 3: The "Show Me" Challenge

For every claim you make, imagine the audience saying "Show me." Can you?

| Claim | "Show Me" Response |
|-------|--------------------|
| "We are fast" | Live demo: task completes in 3 seconds |
| "Customers love us" | Screenshot of a real review with the customer's name |
| "We save you money" | Calculator: enter your numbers, see the savings |
| "Easy to learn" | Video: new user going from signup to first result in 90 seconds |

### Exercise 4: The Translation Table

Create a two-column table for your product. Left column: every abstract word you use. Right column: the concrete replacement.

Build this into your team's writing process. Keep a running "translation table" that converts your internal jargon into concrete, customer-facing language.

## Industry-Specific Concreteness

| Industry | Abstract Norm | Concrete Alternative |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **SaaS** | "Boost productivity" | "Your team ships 2 more features per sprint" |
| **Healthcare** | "Improve patient outcomes" | "Patients leave the hospital 1.3 days sooner" |
| **Finance** | "Optimize portfolio performance" | "Your retirement fund earned $14,200 more last year than the market average" |
| **Education** | "Enhance learning outcomes" | "Students scored 23 points higher on the state math test" |
| **E-commerce** | "Increase conversions" | "47 more people bought something today than yesterday" |
| **Real estate** | "Premium location" | "8-minute walk to the subway, 3 blocks from the park" |
| **Consulting** | "Drive strategic transformation" | "We helped them close their books in 3 days instead of 21" |
| **Manufacturing** | "Optimize supply chain" | "Parts arrive 2 days earlier, and you hold 30% less inventory" |
