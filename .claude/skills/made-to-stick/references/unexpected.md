# Unexpected: Breaking Patterns and Creating Curiosity

The Unexpected principle serves two distinct purposes: getting attention and holding it. Surprise breaks through the noise and grabs attention. Curiosity gaps sustain it long enough for your message to land. Without the unexpected, your message is wallpaper — present but invisible.

## The Two Tasks of Unexpectedness

| Task | Mechanism | Duration | Goal |
|------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Get attention** | Surprise | Instant (seconds) | Break the pattern, interrupt autopilot |
| **Hold attention** | Curiosity | Sustained (minutes to hours) | Keep them engaged until the payoff |

Both are necessary. Surprise without curiosity is a firecracker — loud but forgotten. Curiosity without surprise never gets the chance to work because no one is paying attention in the first place.

## Getting Attention: Pattern-Breaking Surprise

The human brain runs on patterns. We predict what comes next based on what came before. When a prediction fails, we pay attention. That is surprise.

### How Surprise Works

1. **Your audience has an expectation** (a mental pattern or schema)
2. **You violate that expectation** (something does not fit the pattern)
3. **The brain flags the violation** (surprise = involuntary attention)
4. **You resolve the surprise** by connecting it back to your core message

### The Critical Step Most People Miss

Surprise alone is not sticky. The surprise must serve the core message. A dancing monkey in your presentation gets attention but teaches nothing. The resolution of the surprise — the "aha" moment — is where stickiness happens.

### Surprise Mechanics: A Three-Step Process

**Step 1: Identify your core message**
What is the one thing you need the audience to understand or believe?

**Step 2: Find the counterintuitive aspect**
What is surprising, unexpected, or non-obvious about your core message? Where does common sense get it wrong?

**Step 3: Communicate the surprise**
Lead with the pattern violation. Then resolve it with your core message.

### Examples of the Three-Step Process

| Core Message | Counterintuitive Aspect | Surprise Communication |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Movie popcorn is unhealthy | People think popcorn is a light snack | "Your bag of movie popcorn has more saturated fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac with fries, AND a steak dinner — combined." |
| Our product saves time | People assume setup takes forever | "Most tools promise to save time after weeks of setup. Ours saves time during setup." |
| Customer support matters | Companies invest in acquisition, not retention | "You spend $50 to acquire a customer and $0 to keep them. We flip that math." |
| Simplicity wins | People equate features with value | "We removed 60% of our features. Revenue went up 40%." |

## Holding Attention: Curiosity Gaps

Curiosity is the intellectual need to close an open gap in knowledge. Psychologist George Loewenstein identified this as the "information gap" theory of curiosity: when we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know, we feel a strong urge to close it.

### The Gap Theory of Curiosity (George Loewenstein)

Loewenstein's research established four key principles:

1. **Curiosity arises from a gap in knowledge** — not from a complete absence of knowledge. You need to know something to realize what you do not know.
2. **The gap must feel closeable** — if the answer seems unknowable, curiosity dies. If it seems within reach, curiosity intensifies.
3. **Curiosity is aversive** — it is a form of intellectual discomfort. People are motivated to close the gap to relieve the discomfort.
4. **Curiosity increases as you get closer to the answer** — partial information fuels more curiosity, not less.

### Practical Implication

Before you can create a curiosity gap, you must first ensure your audience has enough context to realize something is missing. This is why good teachers provide context before asking a question, and why mystery novels give you clues before the reveal.

### Techniques for Creating Curiosity Gaps

#### 1. Questions

Ask a question your audience cannot immediately answer but desperately wants to.

| Weak Question (No Gap) | Strong Question (Creates Gap) |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| "Want to save money?" | "What is the one expense you pay every month that you could eliminate today?" |
| "Is your team productive?" | "How many hours per week does your best engineer spend NOT coding?" |
| "Do you want more customers?" | "Why did 73% of your trial users quit on day 3?" |

#### 2. Predictions

Ask the audience to predict an outcome before revealing it. Their commitment to their prediction makes them hungry for the answer.

**Examples:**
- "Before I show you the results, guess what percentage of users completed onboarding. Write it down."
- "How long do you think it takes the average customer to see ROI with our product? Most people guess 3 months."
- "What do you think is the number one reason deals stall in your pipeline?"

#### 3. Mysteries

Present an unexplained phenomenon and delay the explanation.

**Examples:**
- "In 2019, a small SaaS company with 4 employees beat Salesforce in 3 enterprise deals. Here is how."
- "Nordstrom once gave a customer a full refund for a set of tires. Nordstrom does not sell tires. Why would they do that?"
- "One email subject line generated a 94% open rate. It had only two words."

#### 4. Challenges to Assumptions

State something your audience believes, then reveal it is wrong.

**Examples:**
- "You have been told content is king. It is not. Distribution is."
- "Everyone says you need product-market fit first. The most successful founders we studied did something else."
- "The best-performing landing page in our test had no hero image, no testimonials, and no CTA button above the fold."

## Before/After: Adding Unexpectedness

### Product Launch Announcement

**Before (Expected):**
> "We are excited to announce our new analytics dashboard with real-time insights, custom reports, and team collaboration features."

**After (Unexpected):**
> "Most analytics dashboards create more questions than answers. So we built one that only shows you the three numbers that matter for your business today."

### Conference Presentation Opening

**Before (Expected):**
> "Good morning. Today I will be talking about the future of AI in healthcare. I have 30 slides to share."

**After (Unexpected):**
> "Last year, an AI diagnosed a rare disease in 12 seconds. The patient had seen 7 doctors over 3 years. None of them caught it. Let me tell you that story."

### Sales Email

**Before (Expected):**
> "Hi [Name], I wanted to reach out to introduce our platform that helps companies improve their sales process."

**After (Unexpected):**
> "Hi [Name], your last three job postings all mention 'data-driven sales culture.' But I noticed your team is still using spreadsheets to forecast. There is a disconnect — and it is costing you about $200K a year."

### Pricing Page

**Before (Expected):**
> "Choose the plan that is right for you. Basic: $29/mo. Pro: $99/mo. Enterprise: Contact us."

**After (Unexpected):**
> "83% of our customers choose Pro. But 40% of them do not need it. Take our 2-minute quiz to find out which plan actually fits — we would rather you save money and stay for years."

### Onboarding Welcome Screen

**Before (Expected):**
> "Welcome to [Product]! Let us get you set up. Click 'Next' to begin."

**After (Unexpected):**
> "In the next 3 minutes, you are going to see something that took your team 3 hours last week happen automatically. Ready?"

## Surprise in Different Contexts

### Product Launches

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reveal a hidden cost** | "You are spending $4,000/month on a tool your team uses for 2 features. Here are those 2 features, free." |
| **Contradict best practices** | "We broke every rule of SaaS pricing. Here is why it works." |
| **Show an extreme outcome** | "One customer saved $2.4 million in their first year. They almost did not sign up." |

### Presentations and Pitches

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Open with the end** | "By the end of this demo, you will have canceled a meeting on your calendar. Let me show you why." |
| **Start with failure** | "Our first version was terrible. Customers hated it. That is the most important thing I can tell you about our product today." |
| **Use a prop or demo** | "This USB stick contains every customer complaint from last quarter. Watch what happens when I plug it in." |

### Marketing Campaigns

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reframe the problem** | "You do not have a lead generation problem. You have a lead quality problem." |
| **Use specificity** | "This ad was written by AI in 4.7 seconds. Can you tell?" |
| **Reverse the pitch** | "5 reasons you should NOT buy our product" (filter for ideal customers) |

## Anti-Patterns: When Surprise Goes Wrong

### Gimmicky Surprise Without Substance

The surprise must connect to your core message. If it does not, you get attention but waste it.

| Gimmicky (Avoid) | Substantive (Aim For) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Clickbait headline with unrelated content | Headline that surprises AND delivers |
| Shock value for its own sake | Unexpected truth that changes perspective |
| "You won't believe what happened next" | "Here is why the obvious answer is wrong" |
| Random humor unrelated to the message | Humor that illuminates the core insight |

### Other Anti-Patterns

- **The bait-and-switch:** Promising one thing, delivering another. Destroys trust.
- **The false mystery:** Creating a curiosity gap with a disappointing payoff. Worse than no gap at all.
- **The overused surprise:** "Everything you know about X is wrong" only works if you actually deliver a genuine insight.
- **The unresolved surprise:** Getting attention but never connecting it back to your core message.

## Exercises for Finding the Unexpected Angle

### Exercise 1: The "Common Sense" Audit

1. Write down the five things everyone in your industry "knows to be true"
2. For each one, find evidence that it is wrong, incomplete, or misleading
3. The strongest counterpoint is your unexpected angle

### Exercise 2: The Prediction Game

1. Present your key statistic or finding to 10 people
2. But first, ask them to predict the answer
3. The statistics where predictions are furthest from reality are your most surprising points

### Exercise 3: The "What If" Flip

Take your core message and flip every assumption:
- "Our product is fast" becomes "What if speed is the wrong metric?"
- "We save you money" becomes "What if your biggest cost is not money but attention?"
- "We are the market leader" becomes "What if being the leader is the problem?"

### Exercise 4: The News Reporter Test

If a journalist were writing about your product, what angle would make it newsworthy? News is inherently about the unexpected. If you cannot find a news angle, you have not found the surprise yet.

### Exercise 5: The Outsider Perspective

Show your message to someone outside your industry. Ask them what surprises them about it. Often, what feels obvious to insiders is genuinely surprising to outsiders — and that surprise is the angle you should lead with.

## Curiosity Gap Checklist

Before finalizing any message, verify:

- [ ] There is a genuine surprise that connects to the core message
- [ ] The surprise violates a specific expectation (not just generic "wow")
- [ ] A curiosity gap is opened early and resolved with a satisfying payoff
- [ ] The audience has enough context to feel the gap (not too much, not too little)
- [ ] The unexpected element is not gimmicky — it deepens understanding
- [ ] The payoff delivers on the promise of the surprise
- [ ] You have tested it on at least one person who did not see it coming

## The Unexpectedness Spectrum

Not all surprise is equal. Use this spectrum to calibrate:

| Level | Type | Effect | Risk |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Mild twist** | "Huh, I did not know that" | Low impact but safe |
| 2 | **Reframe** | "I never thought about it that way" | High impact, moderate risk |
| 3 | **Counterintuitive** | "Wait, that goes against everything I believed" | Very high impact, requires strong evidence |
| 4 | **Paradigm shift** | "This changes everything" | Transformative but hard to achieve |

Aim for Level 2-3 in most product messaging. Level 1 is forgettable. Level 4 requires extraordinary proof.
