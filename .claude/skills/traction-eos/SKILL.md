# Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)

A complete system for running a business with six key components. Designed for entrepreneurial companies ($2M-$50M revenue, 10-250 employees) that want to align vision and execution.

## Core Principle

**Most businesses suffer from the same core issues: people, vision, traction.** EOS provides a simple, complete operating system that strengthens the Six Key Components of any organization.

**The foundation:** Great vision without traction is hallucination. Traction without vision is aimless. EOS connects the two through a practical, weekly operating rhythm.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When evaluating or implementing business processes, rate 0-10 based on EOS component strength. A 10/10 means all six components are strong, meetings are productive, and quarterly rocks are consistently achieved; lower scores indicate gaps. Always provide current score and improvements to reach 10/10.

## The Six Key Components

```
Vision → People → Data → Issues → Process → Traction
```

Every business is built on these six components. EOS strengthens all six.

### 1. Vision Component

**Question:** Does everyone in the organization know where you're going and how you plan to get there?

**Tool: Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO)**

The V/TO answers eight questions on two pages:

| Question | What It Defines | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Core Values** | 3-7 non-negotiable beliefs | "Own it", "Do the right thing", "Grow or die" |
| **Core Focus** | Purpose/cause/passion + niche | "Simplify small business" + "Cloud accounting" |
| **10-Year Target** | Big, hairy, audacious goal | "$100M revenue" or "10,000 customers" |
| **Marketing Strategy** | Target market, 3 uniques, proven process, guarantee | Who you serve, why you're different |
| **3-Year Picture** | What company looks like in 3 years | Revenue, profit, headcount, key metrics |
| **1-Year Plan** | Revenue, profit, measurables, goals | Specific targets for this year |
| **Quarterly Rocks** | 3-7 priorities for this quarter | The most important things to accomplish in 90 days |
| **Issues List** | All unresolved obstacles | Problems, ideas, opportunities to discuss |

**Process:**
1. Leadership team completes V/TO together (2-day off-site)
2. Share with entire organization
3. Review quarterly
4. Update annually

**Key insight:** If leadership team can't agree on V/TO, you have a bigger problem. Alignment comes first.

See: [references/vto.md](references/vto.md) for V/TO templates and exercises.

### 2. People Component

**Question:** Do you have the right people in the right seats?

**Tool: Accountability Chart**

Not an org chart—an accountability chart. Defines the structure and who owns what.

**Structure:**
```
Visionary ←→ Integrator
              ├── Sales/Marketing
              ├── Operations
              └── Finance
```

**Two key roles:**
- **Visionary:** Big ideas, culture, key relationships, creative problem solving
- **Integrator:** Runs business day-to-day, manages team, executes vision, resolves conflicts

**Rule:** One person per seat. No shared accountability.

**Tool: People Analyzer**

Evaluate every person on two dimensions:

**1. Right Person (core values fit)**

| Core Value | + (most of the time) | +/- (sometimes) | - (rarely) |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Own it | + | | |
| Do the right thing | | +/- | |
| Grow or die | + | | |

**Standard:** Must be "+" on all core values. One "+/-" is a conversation. Any "-" is wrong person.

**2. Right Seat (GWC)**
- **G**et it: Understands the role
- **W**ant it: Genuinely wants the role
- **C**apacity: Has the mental, physical, emotional capacity

**Must be "yes" on all three.** If missing any one, wrong seat.

**The formula:** Right People + Right Seats = A-players

**People decisions:**
- Right person, right seat → Keep and invest in
- Right person, wrong seat → Move to right seat
- Wrong person, right seat → Coaching/exit (hardest call)
- Wrong person, wrong seat → Exit immediately

See: [references/people.md](references/people.md) for accountability chart and people analyzer templates.

### 3. Data Component

**Question:** Are you managing based on objective data, or subjective opinions?

**Tool: Scorecard**

A weekly report card of 5-15 numbers that tell you how the business is doing.

**Scorecard rules:**
- Activity-based metrics (leading indicators), not results (lagging)
- Weekly numbers (monthly is too slow)
- Every number has an owner
- Every number has a goal
- Red/green: on track or off track

**Example Scorecard:**

| Metric | Owner | Goal | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 |
|--------|-------|------|----|----|----|----|
| Revenue | Sales Lead | $50K/wk | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| New Leads | Marketing | 100/wk | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Demos Completed | Sales | 20/wk | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Customer NPS | Support | >50 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cash Balance | Finance | >$200K | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Benefits:**
- Spot problems 2-4 weeks earlier
- Reduce "gut feeling" management
- Create accountability without micromanagement
- Everyone knows the score

**Metric selection:** If you had to go on vacation for 4 weeks, what 5-15 numbers would tell you how the business is doing?

See: [references/data.md](references/data.md) for scorecard templates and metric selection.

### 4. Issues Component

**Question:** Are you identifying, discussing, and solving issues quickly?

**Tool: Issues Solving Track (IDS)**

**I**dentify → **D**iscuss → **S**olve

**Step 1: Identify**
- What's the real issue? (Not the symptom)
- Ask "Why?" until you reach root cause
- State the issue in one sentence

**Step 2: Discuss**
- Everyone gets input (not equal time)
- Tangents are stopped
- Focus on the ONE issue
- Time-boxed (usually 5-15 minutes)

**Step 3: Solve**
- Decision is made
- Action items are assigned (who + what + when)
- Move to next issue

**Three types of issues:**

| Type | Examples | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Problems** | Customer churn, team conflict, system outage | IDS → solve |
| **Ideas** | New feature, process change, market opportunity | IDS → decide (yes/no/later) |
| **Obstacles** | Blocking a rock, resource constraint, dependency | IDS → remove or escalate |

**Issues list rules:**
- Everyone can add issues
- Prioritize: most important first
- Not all issues get solved every meeting
- Unsolved issues carry forward

**Common IDS mistakes:**
- Discussing symptoms, not root cause
- Rehashing same issue every week
- No clear action items
- Too much discussion, not enough solving

See: [references/issues.md](references/issues.md) for IDS facilitation guides.

### 5. Process Component

**Question:** Have you documented and consistently followed your core processes?

**Tool: Core Process Documentation**

**The 20/80 rule:** Document 20% of your processes to get 80% consistency.

**Identify core processes:**
- HR process (hiring, onboarding, reviews)
- Sales process (lead → close)
- Operations process (delivery, fulfillment)
- Customer service process (support → resolution)
- Finance process (invoicing, collections)

**Documentation format:**
1. Name the process
2. List 5-20 major steps
3. Add just enough detail (not a 50-page manual)
4. Make it visual where possible

**Example: Sales Process "The Closer"**
1. Qualify lead (BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
2. Discovery call (30 min, use question guide)
3. Demo (customize to their pain points)
4. Proposal (send within 24 hours)
5. Follow up (3 touches in 7 days)
6. Close or disqualify

**Followed By All (FBA):**
- Document it
- Train on it
- Measure compliance
- Update quarterly

See: [references/process.md](references/process.md) for process documentation templates.

### 6. Traction Component

**Question:** Are you executing on your vision every day?

**Two tools: Rocks and Level 10 Meetings**

#### Rocks (Quarterly Priorities)

**Definition:** The 3-7 most important things to accomplish in the next 90 days.

**Why 90 days?**
- Long enough to accomplish something meaningful
- Short enough to maintain urgency
- Natural human rhythm for focus

**Rock-setting process:**
1. Review V/TO (vision, 3-year, 1-year)
2. Brainstorm: "What must get done this quarter to stay on track?"
3. Narrow to 3-7 company rocks
4. Assign each rock to one owner
5. Each leadership member also has 3-7 individual rocks
6. Share with entire organization
7. Track weekly

**SMART rocks:**
- **S**pecific: "Launch new pricing page" not "improve pricing"
- **M**easurable: Clear completion criteria
- **A**chievable: Can be done in 90 days
- **R**ealistic: Given current resources
- **T**ime-bound: Due end of quarter

**Rock scoring:**
- **Done** = checked off (no partial credit)
- **Not done** = carried forward or dropped
- **Goal:** 80%+ completion rate

**Anti-patterns:**
- Too many rocks (>7) → Focus is diluted
- Rocks too vague → Can't tell if done
- No owner → Nobody accountable
- All rocks are "business as usual" → Not moving the needle

See: [references/rocks.md](references/rocks.md) for rock-setting exercises.

#### Level 10 Meeting (Weekly Leadership Meeting)

**The most important meeting in EOS.** Runs every week, same day, same time, same agenda.

**Duration:** 90 minutes, never longer.

**Agenda:**

| Time | Section | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 5 min | **Segue** | Good news (personal and professional) |
| 5 min | **Scorecard** | Review weekly numbers |
| 5 min | **Rock Review** | On track / Off track for each rock |
| 5 min | **Customer/Employee Headlines** | Quick updates |
| 5 min | **To-Do List** | Review last week's to-dos (done or not done) |
| 60 min | **IDS** | Identify, Discuss, Solve issues |
| 5 min | **Conclude** | Recap to-dos, rate meeting 1-10 |

**Level 10 meeting rules:**
- Starts on time, ends on time (non-negotiable)
- Same day, same time every week
- No phones/laptops (except for agenda)
- IDS gets 60 of 90 minutes (most important part)
- Rate meeting 1-10 at end (target: 8+)
- If below 8, discuss what to improve

**Why "Level 10"?**
- Every meeting is rated 1-10 by participants
- Goal is to consistently achieve 10/10

**To-Do rules:**
- 7-day action items only
- Each has owner and due date
- Done = 100% complete
- 90%+ completion rate is target

See: [references/level-10.md](references/level-10.md) for meeting facilitation guides.

## EOS Implementation Timeline

**Typical rollout: 2 years to full implementation**

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Focus Day** | Day 1 (8 hours) | Accountability chart, rocks, scorecard, Level 10 |
| **Vision Building Day 1** | Month 1 | V/TO: core values, core focus, 10-year target |
| **Vision Building Day 2** | Month 2 | V/TO: marketing strategy, 3-year, 1-year, rocks |
| **Quarterly Sessions** | Every 90 days | Review rocks, set new rocks, IDS major issues |
| **Annual Planning** | Yearly | Full V/TO review, set 1-year plan, Q1 rocks |

**Self-implementation vs. EOS Implementer:**
- Self: Read the book, follow the tools (free, slower)
- EOS Implementer: Certified facilitator guides the process (faster, expensive)

## Organizational Checkup

Rate your company 1-5 on each statement:

| Component | Statement | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Vision** | Leadership team is on the same page with where we're going and how to get there | |
| **People** | We have the right people in the right seats | |
| **Data** | We manage from a weekly scorecard of 5-15 numbers | |
| **Issues** | We solve issues quickly and permanently | |
| **Process** | Core processes are documented and followed by all | |
| **Traction** | We set and achieve 90-day priorities (rocks) | |

**Scoring:**
- 25-30: Strong (maintain and fine-tune)
- 20-24: Good (close gaps)
- 15-19: Average (significant work needed)
- Below 15: Weak (consider EOS implementer)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Skipping Level 10s** | Lose weekly rhythm, issues pile up | Protect meeting, never cancel |
| **Too many rocks** | No focus, nothing gets done | Max 7 company rocks, 3-7 per person |
| **Vague rocks** | Can't tell if done | Write SMART rocks with clear criteria |
| **No scorecard** | Managing by gut, surprises | Choose 5-15 weekly numbers |
| **Wrong people kept** | Drags entire team down | Use People Analyzer, make tough calls |
| **V/TO not shared** | Team doesn't know the vision | Share with entire company |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any business:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Does leadership agree on vision? | Misalignment | Complete V/TO together |
| Right people in right seats? | Performance issues | People Analyzer on all seats |
| Managing from data weekly? | Reactive management | Build weekly scorecard |
| Issues solved permanently? | Same problems repeat | Implement IDS in Level 10s |
| Core processes documented? | Inconsistency | Document top 5 processes |
| 90-day priorities set and tracked? | No traction | Set quarterly rocks |
