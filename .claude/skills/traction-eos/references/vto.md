# Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO) Complete Guide

The Vision/Traction Organizer is the single most important document in EOS. It captures your company's vision on two pages by answering eight critical questions. When the leadership team is aligned on the V/TO, every decision becomes clearer, every hire becomes easier, and every meeting becomes more productive. This guide walks through each question with exercises, templates, and facilitation tips.

## The Eight Questions

The V/TO is divided into two pages: the Vision side (questions 1-4) and the Traction side (questions 5-8). Vision defines where you are going. Traction defines how you will get there.

| Page | Questions | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Vision** | Core Values, Core Focus, 10-Year Target, Marketing Strategy | Long-term identity and direction |
| **Traction** | 3-Year Picture, 1-Year Plan, Quarterly Rocks, Issues List | Near-term execution and priorities |

## Question 1: Core Values

Core values are the defining characteristics of your organization. They are not aspirational slogans posted on a wall. They describe who you truly are at your best.

### Core Values Discovery Exercise

**Step 1: Generate a List (50+ Values)**

Have each leadership team member independently list the qualities they admire most in their best employees, past and present. Think about:
- What made that person exceptional?
- What traits do they share with other top performers?
- What behaviors do you celebrate and reward?

Combine all lists. You should have 40-60 qualities.

**Step 2: Group and Consolidate (15-20 Themes)**

Cluster similar values together. "Integrity," "honesty," and "transparency" might become one theme. Give each cluster a working label.

**Step 3: Debate and Narrow (3-7 Final Values)**

For each candidate value, ask:
- Is this truly a core value, or is it something we wish we were?
- Would we fire a high performer who consistently violated this value?
- Would we keep someone who embodies this value even if they underperformed for a quarter?
- Does this value differentiate us from competitors?

**Step 4: Define Each Value**

Write 2-3 bullet points under each value that describe observable behaviors.

| Core Value | Behavioral Indicators |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Own It** | Takes responsibility without being asked. Admits mistakes quickly. Follows through on every commitment. |
| **Do the Right Thing** | Tells the truth even when it hurts. Puts the customer first. Makes ethical choices under pressure. |
| **Grow or Die** | Seeks feedback actively. Reads, learns, and improves quarterly. Embraces uncomfortable challenges. |

**Common Mistakes:**
- Too many values (more than 7 become impossible to remember)
- Aspirational values instead of actual values
- Generic values that could apply to any company ("excellence," "teamwork")
- Not using values in hiring, firing, and review decisions

## Question 2: Core Focus

Core Focus has two parts: your purpose/cause/passion and your niche. Together, they define what you are best at and why you exist.

### Finding Your Purpose/Cause/Passion

Ask the leadership team:
- Why does this company exist beyond making money?
- What would the world lose if we disappeared?
- What gets us out of bed on the hardest days?

This is not a mission statement. It is one sentence that captures your reason for being.

**Examples:**
- "To simplify small business." (Accounting SaaS)
- "To transform how people learn." (EdTech company)
- "To build things that matter." (Engineering firm)

### Finding Your Niche

Your niche is what you do better than anyone else. Ask:
- What can we be the best in the world at?
- Where do we consistently win against competitors?
- What do customers say is uniquely valuable about us?

**Examples:**
- "Cloud accounting for small businesses" (Niche within accounting)
- "Mobile-first corporate training" (Niche within EdTech)
- "Complex structural engineering in seismic zones" (Niche within engineering)

### Core Focus Template

```
Purpose/Cause/Passion: ________________________________
Niche: ________________________________
```

**Filter test:** Every new opportunity, product, or hire should pass through your Core Focus. If it doesn't align, say no.

## Question 3: 10-Year Target

The 10-Year Target is your Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal (BHAG). It should be specific enough to measure, bold enough to inspire, and clear enough that anyone in the company can understand it.

### BHAG Setting Process

**Step 1:** Have each leadership team member write their version independently.

**Step 2:** Share and discuss. Look for common themes.

**Step 3:** Agree on one target. It should:
- Be a single, clear number or milestone
- Feel achievable but ambitious (60-70% confidence)
- Be measurable with no ambiguity
- Create energy when stated out loud

**Examples by Company Type:**

| Company Type | 10-Year Target |
|-------------|---------------|
| SaaS Startup | $100M ARR |
| Professional Services | 500 employees across 10 offices |
| Manufacturing | Largest custom metal fabricator east of the Mississippi |
| Agency | Serve 1,000 brands generating $1B+ combined revenue |
| Healthcare | 50 clinics across 5 states |

**Common Mistakes:**
- Making it too easy (not inspiring)
- Making it too vague ("be the best")
- Having multiple targets (pick one)
- Changing it every year (it should be stable for a decade)

## Question 4: Marketing Strategy

The Marketing Strategy has four parts that define how you attract and win customers.

### Part A: Target Market

Define your ideal customer with precision:
- **Demographics:** Industry, size, revenue, location, title of buyer
- **Psychographics:** Attitudes, values, pain points, buying behavior
- **The List:** Name 10-20 companies that perfectly represent your target market

### Part B: Three Uniques

List three things that, taken together, differentiate you from every competitor. Each unique alone may not be distinctive. The combination must be.

| Company | Unique 1 | Unique 2 | Unique 3 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Accounting SaaS | Built for non-accountants | Same-day phone support | Automated tax prep |
| Engineering Firm | Seismic specialists | 48-hour turnaround quotes | In-house 3D modeling |
| Marketing Agency | Only B2B SaaS | Performance guarantees | Dedicated strategist |

### Part C: Proven Process

Name and visualize the steps a customer takes from first contact to long-term relationship. Give it a branded name.

**Example: "The Clarity Path"**
1. Discovery Call (30 min)
2. Strategic Assessment (delivered in 5 days)
3. Proposal and Agreement
4. Onboarding Sprint (first 30 days)
5. Quarterly Business Reviews
6. Annual Strategy Reset

### Part D: Guarantee

What promise can you make that removes risk for the buyer?

**Examples:**
- "Your first month free if you don't see ROI by day 30."
- "We'll redo any deliverable you're not satisfied with, no questions asked."
- "100% money-back guarantee for the first 90 days."

## Question 5: 3-Year Picture

Paint a vivid picture of what the company looks like in three years. Be specific enough that everyone can visualize it.

### 3-Year Picture Template

```
Date: ____________ (3 years from today)

Revenue: $____________
Profit: $____________ (______%)
Headcount: ____________
Number of Customers/Clients: ____________
Key Measurables:
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________

What does the company look like?
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________
```

**Example:** "By Dec 31, 2028: $15M revenue, $2.25M profit (15%), 85 people, 600 active accounts. Regional leader in 3 metros, two $5M+ product lines, NPS above 60, leadership team of 6 A-players, Best Places to Work recognition."

## Question 6: 1-Year Plan

The 1-Year Plan makes the 3-Year Picture actionable with specific targets for the next twelve months.

### 1-Year Plan Template

```
Date: ____________ (1 year from today)

Revenue: $____________
Profit: $____________ (______%)

Goals (3-7):
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________
4. ________________________________
5. ________________________________

Budget: ________________________________
```

Every goal should be specific and measurable. "Improve marketing" is not a goal. "Generate 500 qualified leads per month by Q4" is a goal.

## Question 7: Quarterly Rocks

Rocks are the 3-7 most important priorities for the next 90 days. They bridge the gap between the 1-Year Plan and daily execution.

### Rock Integration with V/TO

Rocks should directly support 1-Year Plan goals. If a rock doesn't connect to a goal, question whether it belongs.

| 1-Year Goal | Q1 Rock | Q2 Rock |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Generate 500 leads/month | Launch new website and SEO strategy | Hire content marketing specialist |
| Reach $8M revenue | Close 3 enterprise deals | Launch upsell program for existing accounts |
| Build leadership team | Hire VP of Operations | Complete 90-day onboarding for all new leaders |

## Question 8: Issues List

The Issues List captures everything standing in the way of achieving your vision. It includes problems, ideas, and obstacles at the company level.

**Long-term issues** are strategic and may take quarters to resolve. **Short-term issues** are tactical and should be solved in the next Level 10 meeting.

## Facilitation Tips for V/TO Sessions

### Before the Session

- [ ] Book a two-day off-site away from the office
- [ ] Send pre-work: each leader writes their answers to all eight questions independently
- [ ] Assign a facilitator (either an EOS Implementer or the Integrator)
- [ ] Set ground rules: phones off, laptops closed, all voices heard
- [ ] Prepare a large whiteboard or flip charts

### During the Session

- [ ] Spend Day 1 on Vision (questions 1-4), Day 2 on Traction (questions 5-8)
- [ ] Allow healthy debate but enforce time limits per question
- [ ] Use the "fist to five" technique for consensus (0 = strongly disagree, 5 = fully support)
- [ ] If the team cannot agree after 20 minutes, the Integrator makes the call
- [ ] Record every decision immediately on the V/TO document

### After the Session

- [ ] Clean up the V/TO within 48 hours and distribute to the leadership team
- [ ] Schedule a company-wide meeting to share the V/TO within 30 days
- [ ] Review the V/TO at every quarterly session
- [ ] Update it formally at the annual planning session
- [ ] Post it visibly in the office (or pin it in a shared digital workspace)

### Common Facilitation Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Visionary dominates | Team agrees to avoid conflict | Facilitator calls on each person directly |
| Analysis paralysis | No decisions made | Time-box each question, Integrator breaks ties |
| Too abstract | V/TO reads like a philosophy paper | Force specific numbers and dates for every section |
| Rushed process | Leadership doesn't internalize | Spend the full two days, no shortcuts |
| No follow-through | V/TO sits in a drawer | Review quarterly, reference in every Level 10 meeting |
