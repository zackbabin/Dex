# Issues Component: IDS Process Deep Dive

Every organization has issues. The difference between great companies and mediocre ones is how quickly and permanently they solve them. The Issues Component provides a disciplined process called IDS -- Identify, Discuss, Solve -- that turns chronic problems into resolved action items. This guide covers the full IDS framework, facilitation techniques, issue types, list management, and practice scenarios.

## The IDS Framework

IDS stands for Identify, Discuss, Solve. It is the core problem-solving methodology in EOS, used in every Level 10 meeting and every quarterly session. The framework is deliberately simple because simplicity drives discipline.

```
IDENTIFY the real issue
    ↓
DISCUSS openly and efficiently
    ↓
SOLVE with clear action items
```

### Why IDS Works

| Traditional Problem Solving | IDS |
|---------------------------|-----|
| Discusses symptoms endlessly | Forces identification of root cause first |
| Everyone gets equal airtime | Everyone gets input, not equal time |
| Conversations meander | Tangents are stopped immediately |
| Decisions deferred | Decision made before moving on |
| Vague next steps | Specific who/what/when action items |
| Same issue returns next week | Solved permanently or escalated |

## Step 1: Identify the Real Issue

This is the most critical and most frequently skipped step. Teams jump to discussion before they agree on what the actual issue is.

### Root Cause Analysis

**The symptom is not the issue.** The issue is the root cause underneath the symptom. Use these techniques to dig deeper:

**The Five Whys:**
1. Revenue is down this quarter. Why?
2. We closed fewer deals. Why?
3. We gave fewer demos. Why?
4. We had fewer qualified leads. Why?
5. Our main lead source (paid ads) stopped converting after the algorithm change.

**Root cause:** Overdependence on a single lead source. The fix is not "close more deals." The fix is "diversify lead generation channels."

**The One-Sentence Test:**

After identifying the issue, state it in one sentence. If you cannot state it in one sentence, you have not identified it clearly enough.

| Vague | Clear |
|-------|-------|
| "We have a marketing problem" | "Our paid ad CAC increased 40% after the platform algorithm change and we have no alternative lead channels" |
| "The team isn't performing" | "Three of five reps are below 80% quota because they are not following the demo script" |
| "Customer complaints are up" | "Onboarding takes 3 weeks instead of 1, causing 60% of complaints" |

### Identifying the Real Issue: Checklist

- [ ] State the symptom that surfaced the issue
- [ ] Ask "Why?" at least three times to find the root cause
- [ ] State the root cause in one clear sentence
- [ ] Confirm with the group: "Is this the real issue, or is there something deeper?"
- [ ] If the group disagrees on the root cause, spend more time on Identify before moving to Discuss

## Step 2: Discuss

Discussion is where the team adds perspective, data, and experience. The goal is not consensus. The goal is to hear all relevant input so the best decision can be made.

### Discussion Facilitation Techniques

**The Round-Robin Open:**
Go around the table. Each person gets 60 seconds of uninterrupted input. No rebuttals during the round. This ensures quieter voices are heard before dominant personalities take over.

**The Data Check:**
Before opinions fly, ask: "What data do we have on this?" Opinions without data are just guesses. If no data exists, note it as an action item to gather data before the next meeting.

**The Tangent Stop:**
When the discussion drifts off topic, the facilitator says: "That's a separate issue. I'm adding it to the Issues List. Let's get back to [original issue]." No apology needed. This is not rude -- it is discipline.

**The Devil's Advocate:**
If the group is quickly converging on a solution, pause and ask: "What could go wrong with this approach?" or "If we're wrong, what would that look like?" This prevents groupthink.

**Time-Boxing:**
Most issues should take 5-15 minutes to IDS. If an issue is taking longer than 15 minutes:
- The issue may be too big for a Level 10 meeting (move to a separate meeting)
- The team may not have enough information (create a to-do to gather data)
- The facilitator may be allowing tangents (tighten the discussion)

### Discussion Ground Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| One conversation at a time | Side conversations split attention |
| No devices | Full presence required |
| Attack the issue, not the person | Psychological safety enables honest input |
| Share your perspective, then let go | Once you've said it, trust the process |
| Facilitator controls the floor | Prevents dominant personalities from hijacking |
| Silence is agreement | If you don't speak up, you support the outcome |

## Step 3: Solve

Solving means making a decision and assigning action items. A discussion without a clear decision and next steps is wasted time.

### The Solve Protocol

1. **State the decision.** The facilitator summarizes: "Here is what we've decided."
2. **Confirm agreement.** Quick fist-to-five: 0 = block, 3 = can live with it, 5 = love it. Anything 3+ moves forward.
3. **Assign action items.** Every action item has three elements:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Who** | Sarah |
| **What** | Research three alternative lead gen channels and present options |
| **When** | By next Tuesday's Level 10 |

4. **Record it.** The action item goes on the To-Do List (7-day items) or becomes a Rock (if it is a 90-day initiative).
5. **Move on.** Do not revisit. Do not second-guess. The decision is made.

### Solve Outcomes

Not every issue results in an action item. There are several possible outcomes:

| Outcome | When to Use | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Action item (To-Do)** | Issue can be resolved in 7 days | "Jordan will update the pricing page by Friday" |
| **Rock** | Issue requires 90 days of effort | "Launch customer success program" becomes a Q2 rock |
| **Kill it** | Issue is not worth pursuing | "We decided the new feature request doesn't align with our Core Focus" |
| **Information needed** | Cannot decide without data | "Alex will pull churn data by cohort and present next week" |
| **Escalate** | Beyond the team's authority | "This requires board approval; Integrator will present at next board meeting" |
| **Combine** | Issue is a duplicate | "This is the same root cause as issue #3; we'll solve them together" |

## Three Types of Issues

### Problems

**Definition:** Something that is broken, underperforming, or causing pain.

**Examples:**
- Customer churn increased from 3% to 7% this quarter
- Two team members are in open conflict and it is affecting the department
- Our main vendor raised prices 25% and our margins are squeezed

**IDS approach:** Focus on root cause. The fix should prevent recurrence, not just patch the symptom.

### Ideas

**Definition:** A new opportunity, initiative, or approach that someone wants to propose.

**Examples:**
- "What if we added a freemium tier to our product?"
- "I think we should open a second office in Austin."
- "Should we sponsor the industry conference this year?"

**IDS approach:** The decision is yes, no, or not now. If yes, it becomes a to-do or rock. If not now, it stays on the long-term Issues List.

### Obstacles

**Definition:** Something blocking a Rock or key initiative from moving forward.

**Examples:**
- Engineering capacity is blocking the product launch rock
- Legal review is delaying the partnership agreement
- Budget constraints prevent hiring the needed role

**IDS approach:** Remove the obstacle or find a workaround. If the obstacle is outside the team's control, escalate it.

## Issues List Management

### Two Lists

EOS maintains two Issues Lists:

| List | Contents | Reviewed |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Short-Term (Level 10)** | Tactical issues for this week | Every Level 10 meeting |
| **Long-Term (V/TO)** | Strategic issues for quarterly sessions | Every quarterly session |

### Adding Issues

Anyone in the organization can add issues to either list. The format is simple: a short phrase that captures the issue. Details are discussed live during IDS.

**Good issue entries:**
- "Sales demo no-show rate is 40%"
- "Need to decide on CRM migration"
- "Conflict between engineering and product on roadmap priorities"

**Poor issue entries:**
- "Marketing" (too vague)
- "Everything" (not an issue)
- Three paragraphs of background (save it for discussion)

### Prioritizing Issues

At the start of IDS in every Level 10 meeting:

1. **Review the list.** Read each issue title aloud.
2. **Identify the top 3.** Ask: "Which three issues, if solved today, would have the biggest impact?"
3. **Number them 1, 2, 3.** Start with number 1.
4. **Re-prioritize after each solve.** The top 3 may shift as issues are resolved.

**Critical rule:** Not all issues get solved every meeting. That is expected. Unsolved issues carry forward to next week. What matters is that you always work on the most important issues first.

### Issue Hygiene

Every quarter, review the long-term Issues List:
- Remove issues that are no longer relevant
- Promote issues that have become urgent to the short-term list
- Merge duplicate issues
- Clarify vague entries

## Common IDS Facilitation Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Skipping Identify** | Team solves the wrong problem | Require the one-sentence root cause statement before any discussion |
| **Discussion without structure** | Conversation goes in circles | Use round-robin, then open discussion, then time-box |
| **Allowing tangents** | Meeting goes long, real issues not addressed | Facilitator immediately names tangent and redirects |
| **Seeking consensus** | Decisions watered down to please everyone | Integrator makes the call if team cannot agree in 15 minutes |
| **No action items** | "Great discussion" but nothing changes | Facilitator does not close an issue without who/what/when |
| **Rehashing solved issues** | Undermines the process, wastes time | Once solved, it is done. If the solution did not work, it is a new issue |
| **One person dominates** | Other perspectives are lost | Facilitator actively invites input: "We haven't heard from you, what's your take?" |
| **Too polite** | Real issues avoided to maintain comfort | Establish that healthy conflict is expected and valued |
| **Solving symptoms** | Root cause persists, issue returns | Ask "Why?" at least three times before moving to Discuss |

## Practice Scenarios for IDS Training

Use these scenarios to practice IDS with your leadership team. Each scenario should take 10-15 minutes.

### Scenario 1: The Underperforming Sales Rep

**Symptom:** Q2 revenue is 20% below target.

**Information revealed during Identify:**
- One of four reps is at 30% of quota
- That rep was a top performer last year
- They recently took on a new territory
- Their pipeline is full but close rate dropped from 30% to 8%

**Practice questions:**
- What is the real issue? (Symptom vs. root cause)
- What data would you want before discussing solutions?
- What are three possible root causes?

### Scenario 2: The Competing Priorities

**Symptom:** Engineering team missed their Rock deadline by four weeks.

**Information revealed during Identify:**
- The VP of Sales requested "urgent" feature changes mid-quarter
- Engineering spent 3 weeks on unplanned work
- No one in leadership approved the scope change
- This is the third quarter in a row this has happened

**Practice questions:**
- Who owns the decision about engineering priorities?
- Is this a people issue, a process issue, or both?
- What structural change would prevent recurrence?

### Scenario 3: The Culture Problem

**Symptom:** Three employees resigned in the past month, all citing "culture."

**Information revealed during Identify:**
- Exit interviews mention a specific manager who "rules by fear"
- That manager's team has the highest performance metrics in the company
- Two of the departing employees were identified as high-potential
- The manager has been with the company for seven years

**Practice questions:**
- Is this a right person or right seat issue?
- How do you weigh performance metrics against culture impact?
- What is the root cause: the manager's behavior, or the system that enabled it?

### Scenario 4: The Strategic Opportunity

**Symptom:** A major competitor just went out of business, freeing up 200 potential customers.

**Information revealed during Identify:**
- Your team is already at capacity
- Hiring 5 new reps would take 3-4 months
- A partner firm could handle overflow but at lower margins
- The window of opportunity is 60-90 days before other competitors move in

**Practice questions:**
- Is this a problem, an idea, or an obstacle?
- What is the core decision that needs to be made?
- What are the trade-offs of each option?

### Scenario 5: The Process Breakdown

**Symptom:** Customer onboarding satisfaction dropped from 4.5 to 3.2 out of 5.

**Information revealed during Identify:**
- The onboarding team grew from 2 to 6 people in the past quarter
- The four new hires were trained informally by the two original team members
- There is no documented onboarding process
- The two original team members each do onboarding differently

**Practice questions:**
- Which EOS component is this really about? (Process? People? Both?)
- What is the fastest fix? What is the permanent fix?
- How would you prevent this from recurring as the team continues to grow?
