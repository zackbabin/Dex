# Level 10 Meeting: Complete Facilitation Guide

The Level 10 Meeting is the most important meeting in the Entrepreneurial Operating System. It is a weekly, 90-minute leadership team meeting that follows a precise agenda, creates accountability, surfaces issues, and keeps the company on track. When run well, it eliminates the need for most other meetings. This guide covers every section of the agenda, facilitation protocols, rules, and how to consistently score 8 or higher.

## Why "Level 10"

At the end of every Level 10 meeting, each participant rates the meeting on a scale of 1-10. The goal is for every meeting to score a 10 -- hence the name. In practice, teams aim for a consistent 8 or above. The rating system creates a feedback loop: if the meeting scores below 8, the team discusses what to improve, and the facilitator adjusts.

## The Non-Negotiable Rules

Before diving into the agenda, these rules are absolute:

| Rule | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| Same day, same time, every week | Rhythm creates discipline. No rescheduling. |
| Starts on time | Waiting for stragglers trains people to be late. Start without them. |
| Ends on time (90 minutes) | Parkinson's law: work expands to fill the time available. Hard stop at 90 minutes. |
| No cancellations | The meeting happens even if two people are out. Cancel only for true emergencies (office fire, not a client call). |
| Full attendance expected | If someone misses more than 2 in a quarter, it is an issue to IDS. |
| No phones or laptops | Except for the person taking notes and anyone referencing the shared agenda. |
| One conversation at a time | Side conversations are stopped immediately by the facilitator. |

## The 90-Minute Agenda

The agenda is fixed. It does not change week to week. This predictability is a feature, not a bug. Everyone knows exactly what to expect, which reduces meeting anxiety and increases preparation.

```
00:00 - 05:00  Segue (Good News)
05:00 - 10:00  Scorecard Review
10:00 - 15:00  Rock Review
15:00 - 20:00  Customer/Employee Headlines
20:00 - 25:00  To-Do List Review
25:00 - 85:00  IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve)
85:00 - 90:00  Conclude
```

## Section 1: Segue (5 Minutes)

### Purpose

Start with a human connection. Each person shares one piece of good news -- personal or professional. This transitions the team from whatever they were doing before the meeting into a present, connected state.

### Protocol

- Go around the table, one person at a time
- 30-45 seconds per person
- Personal news is encouraged (not just work wins)
- No discussion or follow-up questions during the segue
- The facilitator keeps it moving

### Examples of Good Segue News
- "My daughter scored her first soccer goal this weekend."
- "We just signed a deal I've been working on for three months."
- "I finished a half marathon on Saturday."
- "Our team hit 100% on their to-dos for the first time."

### Why It Matters

The Segue sets the tone. Teams that skip it jump straight into problems and data without any human connection. The 5-minute investment builds trust and camaraderie that pays dividends during difficult IDS conversations later in the meeting.

## Section 2: Scorecard Review (5 Minutes)

### Purpose

Review the weekly Scorecard to identify any metrics that are off track.

### Protocol

1. Display the Scorecard (screen, projector, or printout)
2. Go metric by metric. The owner states the number.
3. If the number is on track (green), move on. No discussion.
4. If the number is off track (red), the owner says: "Off track. Dropping to Issues List."
5. No discussion during Scorecard review. All off-track numbers will be IDS'd later.
6. Total time: 5 minutes maximum.

### Facilitator Tips

- Move quickly. The Scorecard is a scan, not a deep dive.
- If someone starts explaining why a number is red, gently stop them: "We'll get to it during IDS."
- Track consecutive red weeks. Three in a row means it automatically becomes the first issue in IDS.

## Section 3: Rock Review (5 Minutes)

### Purpose

Review the status of every quarterly Rock to ensure progress is on track.

### Protocol

1. Display the Rock sheet
2. Go person by person. Each leader states each Rock and one word: "On track" or "Off track."
3. No discussion or explanation during review
4. Off-track rocks are noted and may be added to the Issues List
5. Total time: 5 minutes

### On Track vs. Off Track

A Rock is on track if the owner believes, based on current progress, it will be completed by the end of the quarter. It is off track if there is meaningful risk of missing the deadline.

**Rules:**
- Be honest. Declaring "on track" when you know it is at risk wastes the team's time when the truth surfaces later.
- Off track is not shameful. It is information that lets the team help.
- If a Rock has been off track for 3+ consecutive weeks, it must be IDS'd.

## Section 4: Customer/Employee Headlines (5 Minutes)

### Purpose

Share brief, important updates about customers and employees that the leadership team needs to know about.

### Protocol

1. Go around the table
2. Each person shares 1-2 headlines (not stories, headlines)
3. Format: "[Good/Bad news]: [One sentence summary]"
4. If a headline needs discussion, it drops to the Issues List
5. Total time: 5 minutes

### Examples

| Type | Headline |
|------|----------|
| Customer (positive) | "Acme Corp renewed for 3 years and doubled their contract" |
| Customer (negative) | "Beta Industries is threatening to leave due to implementation delays" |
| Employee (positive) | "Sarah passed her certification exam on the first attempt" |
| Employee (negative) | "We lost two engineers to a competitor this week" |

### Headlines, Not Stories

The facilitator must enforce brevity. A headline is one sentence. If someone starts telling a story, redirect: "That sounds important. Add it to the Issues List and we'll IDS it."

## Section 5: To-Do List Review (5 Minutes)

### Purpose

Review every to-do from the previous week and confirm whether it is done or not done.

### Protocol

1. Display the to-do list from last week
2. Read each to-do. The owner states: "Done" or "Not done."
3. Done to-dos are checked off and removed
4. Not-done to-dos are either carried forward (one more week) or dropped to the Issues List
5. Total time: 5 minutes

### To-Do Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| 7-day items only | To-dos are completed within one week |
| 100% = done | Partial completion is "not done" |
| Each to-do has an owner | One name, no shared ownership |
| Target: 90%+ completion | If the team consistently falls below 90%, it is an issue |
| Carried forward once | If a to-do is not done two weeks in a row, it goes to IDS |

### What Makes a Good To-Do

- "Jordan: Send revised proposal to Acme Corp by Friday" (clear)
- "Look into marketing stuff" (too vague -- who? what? when?)

Every to-do must answer: Who will do what by when?

## Section 6: IDS -- The Core of the Meeting (60 Minutes)

### Purpose

Identify, Discuss, and Solve the most important issues facing the organization. This is where the real work of the Level 10 meeting happens.

### Protocol

**Step 1: Build the Issues List (2 minutes)**
- Ask: "Does anyone have new issues to add?"
- Quickly capture new issues in 3-5 words each

**Step 2: Prioritize (3 minutes)**
- Read the full list aloud
- Ask: "What are the top 3 issues? Which three, if solved today, would have the greatest impact?"
- Number them 1, 2, 3

**Step 3: IDS Issue #1**
- **Identify:** The person who raised the issue states it clearly in one sentence. Ask: "What is the real issue here?" Dig to root cause.
- **Discuss:** Open the floor. Relevant perspectives are shared. Facilitator stops tangents.
- **Solve:** The team decides. Action items are created with who/what/when. The issue is resolved or escalated.

**Step 4: Repeat for remaining issues**
- After each issue, re-prioritize remaining issues
- Continue until the 60 minutes are up
- Unsolved issues carry forward to next week

### Time Management During IDS

| Issue Complexity | Typical Time | Facilitator Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Simple decision | 5 minutes | Drive quickly to a decision |
| Moderate discussion | 10-15 minutes | Allow input, then push for resolution |
| Complex strategic issue | 15-20 minutes | If not resolved in 20 minutes, create a to-do to schedule a separate meeting |
| Recurring issue | Varies | Address why it keeps recurring, not just the symptom |

### The Facilitator's Job During IDS

The facilitator (typically the Integrator) has specific responsibilities:

- **Keep the team on one issue at a time.** When someone introduces a tangent, say: "That's a separate issue. I'm adding it to the list."
- **Push past discussion to solving.** When the conversation is circling, say: "I think we have enough input. What's the decision?"
- **Draw out quiet voices.** Ask: "We haven't heard from you on this. What's your take?"
- **Break ties.** If the team cannot agree after sufficient discussion, the Integrator makes the call.
- **Capture action items in real time.** Every solved issue produces a to-do (who, what, when) or a decision.

## Section 7: Conclude (5 Minutes)

### Purpose

Wrap up the meeting with clarity on next steps and feedback on meeting quality.

### Protocol

**Step 1: Recap To-Dos (2 minutes)**
Read aloud every new to-do created during the meeting. Confirm each owner understands their commitment.

**Step 2: Cascading Messages (1 minute)**
Ask: "Are there any decisions or messages from this meeting that need to be communicated to your teams?" List them. Ensure consistent messaging.

**Step 3: Rate the Meeting (2 minutes)**
Each person rates the meeting 1-10. Go around the table.
- If the average is 8+: "Great meeting. See you next week."
- If any rating is below 8: Ask that person: "What would have made it an 8?" Take note for next week.

### Rating Criteria

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 10 | Best possible use of 90 minutes. All important issues addressed. Clear outcomes. |
| 8-9 | Productive meeting. Most issues addressed. Minor improvements possible. |
| 6-7 | Decent but felt unfocused or rushed. Key issues may have been skipped. |
| 4-5 | Significant dysfunction. Too much tangent, not enough solving, or wrong issues prioritized. |
| 1-3 | Meeting failed. Waste of time. Fundamental problems with facilitation or participation. |

## How to Consistently Score 8+

### The Preparation Factor

Meetings score higher when people come prepared. Before every Level 10:

- [ ] Scorecard numbers are updated
- [ ] Rock statuses are current
- [ ] To-dos from last week are completed or flagged
- [ ] Issues to raise are thought through (not raised cold)

### The Facilitation Factor

| Technique | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Start on time, every time | Sets the standard for discipline |
| Enforce the agenda strictly | Prevents scope creep and overruns |
| Stop tangents immediately | Keeps IDS focused and productive |
| Push for decisions, not just discussion | Creates momentum and resolution |
| End on time, every time | Builds trust that 90 minutes means 90 minutes |

### The Participation Factor

- Every person speaks during IDS (facilitator draws out quiet members)
- No one dominates (facilitator manages airtime)
- People are honest about off-track rocks and red Scorecard numbers
- The team engages in healthy conflict, not avoidance

## Common Meeting Dysfunctions and Fixes

| Dysfunction | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Tangent spiral** | Discussion jumps from issue to issue without solving any | Facilitator parks tangents: "Good point, adding to the list. Back to the current issue." |
| **One person dominates** | Same voice 70%+ of the time | Facilitator uses round-robin: "Let's hear from everyone. Sarah, you first." |
| **Avoid hard topics** | Elephants in the room are never raised | Facilitator names it: "I sense there's an issue we're avoiding. What is it?" |
| **Scorecard not updated** | Numbers missing or stale | Make it a to-do. If repeated, IDS it as a process issue. |
| **No one rates below 8** | Artificial harmony, no real feedback | Facilitator asks directly: "What specifically would improve this meeting?" |
| **To-dos always incomplete** | Same items carry forward week after week | IDS the pattern. Is it capacity? Commitment? Accountability? |
| **Rocks always on track until week 12** | People hide bad news until the last minute | Create safety for early off-track declarations. Praise honesty, not perfection. |
| **Meeting keeps running over 90 min** | Agenda discipline has broken down | Hard stop at 90 minutes. Unsolved issues carry forward. No exceptions. |
| **People check out during IDS** | Disengagement, phone checking | Remove devices. Facilitator actively engages: "What do you think about this?" |
| **Same issues every week** | IDS is not producing permanent solutions | When solving, ask: "What structural change will prevent this from recurring?" |
