description: Safely update Dex with one command (handles everything automatically)
---

## What This Command Does

**For non-technical users:** Updates Dex to the latest version automatically. No command line knowledge needed - just run the command and follow the prompts.

**When to use:**
- After `/dex-whats-new` shows new version available
- When you want the latest features and bug fixes

**What it handles:**
- Downloads updates automatically
- Protects your data (never touches your notes, tasks, projects)
- Preserves protected user blocks and user-owned MCP entries
- Resolves conflicts with a guided choice (no manual merge editor)
- Shows clear progress and confirmation

**Time:** 2-5 minutes

---

## Process

### Step 1: Pre-Check

**A. Check if Git is available**

Try running basic git command:
```bash
git --version
```

**If Git not found:**
```
❌ Git not detected

Dex updates require Git. Here's how to install:

**Mac:** 
1. Open Terminal (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal")
2. Run: xcode-select --install
3. Click Install when prompted
4. Come back here when done

**Windows:**
1. Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run installer with default options
3. Restart Cursor
4. Try /dex-update again

[Skip update] — I'll do this later
```

If user skips, exit gracefully.

---

**B. Check current setup**

Run: `git remote -v`

**Scenario 1: Downloaded as ZIP (no Git)**
```
❌ Not a Git repository

Looks like you downloaded Dex as a ZIP file instead of cloning it.

**To update:**
1. Download latest version: https://github.com/davekilleen/dex/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. Unzip to a new folder
3. Copy these folders from your current Dex to the new one:
   • System/user-profile.yaml
   • System/pillars.yaml
   • 00-Inbox/
   • 01-Quarter_Goals/
   • 02-Week_Priorities/
   • 03-Tasks/
   • 04-Projects/
   • 05-Areas/
   • 07-Archives/
4. Delete old Dex folder
5. Rename new folder to 'dex'
6. Open in Cursor

[Show detailed guide] — Open step-by-step instructions
[Cancel] — I'll do this later
```

If detailed guide selected, open `06-Resources/Dex_System/Updating_Dex.md` (Manual Update section).

---

**Scenario 2: Cloned but no upstream remote**

If `git remote -v` shows only "origin" pointing to github.com/davekilleen/dex:

```
✓ Git repository detected

Setting up automatic updates...
```

Run:
```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
```

Continue to Step 2.

---

**Scenario 3: Already configured**

If upstream exists, continue to Step 2.

---

### Step 2: Check for Updates

Call update checker:
```
check_for_updates(force=True)
```

**If no updates available:**
```
✅ You're already on the latest version (v1.2.0)

No update needed!
```
Exit.

**If updates available, show summary:**
```
🎁 Dex v1.3.0 is available

You're on: v1.2.0
Latest: v1.3.0

What's new:
- Career coach improvements
- Task deduplication fix  
- Meeting intelligence enhancement

[View full release notes]
[Update now]
[Cancel]
```

---

### Step 3: Pre-Update Safety Check

**A. Check for uncommitted changes**

Run: `git status --porcelain`

**If there are changes:**
```
💾 Saving your work...

Dex found unsaved changes in your vault.
Let me save them before updating.
```

Run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Auto-save before Dex update to v1.3.0"
```

Show:
```
✓ Your work is saved
```

**B. Create backup reference (safety net)**

Run:
```bash
git tag backup-before-v1.3.0
```

This creates a snapshot user can revert to if needed.

---

### Step 4: Download Updates

```
⬇️ Downloading updates from GitHub...
```

Run:
```bash
git fetch upstream
```

**If network error:**
```
❌ Couldn't connect to GitHub

Please check your internet connection and try again.

[Retry]
[Cancel]
```

**Success:**
```
✓ Updates downloaded
```

---

### Step 5: Check for Breaking Changes

Parse the update response from Step 2.

**If `breaking_changes: true`:**

```
⚠️ Important: This update includes major changes

Dex v2.0.0 includes breaking changes that require extra steps:

[Show what's changing]

This is safe to proceed, but:
• Some folders may be renamed
• Configuration format may change  
• Migration will run automatically

[Continue with update]
[Cancel — I'll read the details first]
```

If cancelled:
- Show link to release notes
- Exit gracefully
- User can run `/dex-update` again when ready

---

### Step 6: Apply Updates

```
🔄 Applying updates...
```

**A. Merge updates**

Run:
```bash
git merge upstream/main --no-edit
```

**B. Handle merge outcome**

**Case 1: Clean merge (no conflicts)**
```
✓ Updates applied successfully
```

Continue to Step 7.

---

**Case 2: Merge conflicts**

Check which files have conflicts:
```bash
git status | grep "both modified"
```

**Automatic conflict resolution (protected blocks + guided choices):**

**Protected user blocks (preserved verbatim):**
- `CLAUDE.md` contains a user block:
  - `USER_EXTENSIONS_START` ... `USER_EXTENSIONS_END`

**Custom MCP servers (preserved by name):**
- Any MCP server name starting with `custom-` is preserved
- Example: `custom-gmail`, `custom-hubspot`

**Custom skills (preserved by name):**
- Any skill folder ending with `-custom` is preserved
- Example: `meeting-prep-custom`, `daily-plan-custom`

**When conflicts occur:**

1. **If file is user data** (00-07, System/user-profile.yaml, System/pillars.yaml):
   - Keep user version
   - Run: `git checkout --ours <file>`

2. **If file contains protected user block** (CLAUDE.md):
   - Take upstream version
   - Re-insert preserved user block(s) verbatim
   - Validate markers still present

3. **If file is .mcp.json**:
   - Preserve any MCP entries named `custom-*`
   - Continue with Dex core updates for all other MCPs

4. **If skill folder ends with `-custom`**:
   - Preserve entirely, never modify
   - These are user's personal skills

5. **If file is core Dex** (skills, core MCP, scripts) **and user edited it**:
   - Use AskUserQuestion to resolve, instead of a merge editor

**AskUserQuestion flow (generic, parameterized):**
```
Title: Dex update conflict: {{item_name}}

Your change:
{{user_change_summary}}
Enables: {{user_use_case_summary}}

Dex update:
{{dex_change_summary}}
Enables: {{dex_use_case_summary}}

Options:
1) Keep my version (preserve my changes)
2) Use Dex version (take upstream changes)
3) Keep both (rename one)
4) Let me tell you what to do (I'll write instructions)
```

**If AskUserQuestion is not available (non-Claude Code):**
- Use a simple CLI prompt with the same 4 options.
- Add one-line tradeoffs to each option (what you keep vs lose).
- If user types an invalid choice, re-prompt once and default to "Use Dex version".

**If user chooses "Keep both":**
- MCP: `name` → `name-custom`
- Skill folder: `name/` → `name-custom/`

**After resolving all conflicts:**
```bash
git add <file>
git commit --no-edit
```

**Show to user:**
```
✓ Updates applied successfully

Handled conflicts:
• Preserved your protected blocks
• Updated core Dex features
• Resolved overlapping changes with your choice

[See what changed]
```

---

**Case 3: Merge failed (rare)**

```
❌ Update couldn't complete automatically

This is rare, but sometimes updates need manual review.

**What happened:**
[Error message]

**Options:**
[Restore to before update] — Uses the backup we created
[Get help] — Opens GitHub issue template
```

If restore:
```bash
git merge --abort
git reset --hard backup-before-v1.3.0
```

---

### Step 7: Post-Update Steps

**A. Check for migration needs**

If breaking_changes was true, check for migration script:

```bash
ls core/migrations/v*-to-v*.sh
```

If found:
```
🔧 Running migration...

This update requires a one-time migration to update your data structure.
This is safe and automatic.
```

Run:
```bash
./core/migrations/v1-to-v2.sh --auto
```

Show migration output.

**B. Update dependencies**

```
📦 Updating dependencies...
```

Run:
```bash
npm install
pip3 install -r core/mcp/requirements.txt
```

**C. Sync MCP Configuration (Automatic)**

Check if new MCP servers were added in the update by comparing `.mcp.json.example` entries against the user's live `.mcp.json` (or `System/.mcp.json`).

For each entry in `.mcp.json.example` that is NOT in the user's `.mcp.json`:
1. Read the entry from `.mcp.json.example`
2. Replace `{{VAULT_PATH}}` with the actual vault path
3. Add to the user's `.mcp.json`
4. Log: "✓ Added new MCP server: [name]"

**Never remove or modify existing user MCP entries.** Only add missing ones.

**Example:** If `.mcp.json.example` has `dex-analytics` but user's config doesn't:
```json
"dex-analytics": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["<vault_path>/core/mcp/analytics_server.py"],
  "env": { "VAULT_PATH": "<vault_path>" }
}
```

Add to summary if new MCPs added: "✓ Added new MCP servers: dex-analytics"

**D. Sync Usage Log Features (Automatic)**

Merge new feature entries from the template `System/usage_log.md` into the user's existing `System/usage_log.md`.

**Merge logic:**
1. Read the upstream template `System/usage_log.md` (from the just-updated dex-core files)
2. Read the user's existing `System/usage_log.md`
3. For each `- [ ]` or `- [x]` line in the template:
   - Extract the feature description (text after the checkbox)
   - Search the user's file for a line containing the same feature description
   - **If found:** Keep the user's version (preserves their `[x]` state)
   - **If NOT found:** This is a new feature — add it to the same section in the user's file
4. Preserve ALL user state: checked boxes, consent decisions, journey metadata, dates
5. Update the feature count in `Feature adoption score: X/Y` (Y = new total)

**Section matching:** Match new entries to the correct section by the `## Section Name` headers (e.g., "## Core Workflows", "## Advanced"). If a new section exists in the template but not in the user's file, add the entire section.

**Never:**
- Uncheck a user's checked box
- Change consent or metadata values
- Remove entries the user has

Log: "✓ Added N new features to usage_log.md" (or "✓ Usage log up to date" if nothing added)

**E. Enable new background automations (Automatic)**

Check for automation scripts that need installation. These run silently without prompting.

**Meeting Sync (if Granola detected):**

Check if Granola is installed:
```bash
ls "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Granola/cache-v3.json" 2>/dev/null
```

If Granola cache exists AND meeting automation not yet installed:
```bash
# Check if already installed
launchctl list | grep com.dex.meeting-intel
```

If not installed:
```bash
cd .scripts/meeting-intel && ./install-automation.sh 2>/dev/null
```

Add to summary if installed: "✓ Enabled automatic meeting sync (runs every 30 min)"

**Future automations:** This pattern extends to other background services. Check for the prerequisite (e.g., app installed, API key present), then run the installer silently.

---

### Step 8: Verification

```
✓ Update complete! Now testing...
```

**Quick smoke test:**

1. Check key files exist:
   - `03-Tasks/Tasks.md`
   - `System/user-profile.yaml`
   - `.claude/skills/daily-plan/SKILL.md`

2. Check MCP configuration:
   - `.mcp.json` exists and is valid JSON
   - Custom MCP entries (`custom-*`) still present

3. Check CLAUDE.md:
   - `USER_EXTENSIONS_START/END` markers still present

3. Try loading user profile:
   - Read `System/user-profile.yaml`

**If all pass:**
```
✅ Update successful!
```

**If something fails:**
```
⚠️ Update completed but found an issue

[Details of what failed]

Your data is safe, but you may want to:
[Restore to previous version]
[Report this issue]
[Continue anyway]
```

---

### Step 9b: Check New Integrations (After Success)

After successful update, check if new integration features are available:

```python
from core.integrations import get_post_update_integration_message, should_show_integration_prompt

if should_show_integration_prompt():
    msg = get_post_update_integration_message()
    if msg:
        print(msg)
```

**If integrations are available but not configured:**
```
---

## 🔌 New: Productivity Integrations

This update includes integrations for your favorite tools:

- **Notion** — Search your workspace, pull docs into meeting prep
- **Slack** — Search conversations, get context about people
- **Google** — Gmail search, email context in person pages

**Set up now?** These are optional but unlock powerful features like:
- "What did Sarah say about the Q1 budget?" → Searches Slack
- Meeting prep pulls relevant docs from Notion
- Person pages show email/Slack history

Run `/integrate-notion`, `/integrate-slack`, or `/integrate-google` to set up.
```

**If user has integrations that could be upgraded:**
```
---

## 🔄 Integration Upgrade Available

You have some integrations that could be upgraded to Dex recommended packages:

### Notion
- **Current:** custom-notion-mcp
- **Recommended:** @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
- **Benefits:** Official from Notion, Best maintained, Full API coverage

**Options:**
1. **Keep existing** — Your current setup works fine
2. **Upgrade** — Run `/integrate-notion` to switch to recommended
```

---

### Step 10: Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark Dex update as used.

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `dex_update_completed` and properties:
- `from_version`
- `to_version`

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".

---

## Error Recovery

### If Update Fails at Any Point

User always has escape hatch:

```
🔙 Restoring to before update...
```

Run:
```bash
git merge --abort 2>/dev/null || true
git reset --hard backup-before-v1.3.0
git clean -fd
```

```
✓ Restored to v1.2.0

Nothing was changed. Your Dex is exactly as it was.

[Try update again]
[Report issue]
[Cancel]
```

---

## Migration Support (for Breaking Changes)

### Auto-Migration Flag

If migration script supports `--auto` flag, run non-interactively:

```bash
./core/migrations/v1-to-v2.sh --auto
```

**Migration script must:**
- Accept `--auto` flag
- Skip confirmation prompts
- Return exit code 0 on success
- Log to `System/.migration-log`

### Manual Migration Required

If script doesn't support `--auto`:

```
⚠️ Manual step required

This update needs you to run a migration script.

Don't worry - it's one command and takes 30 seconds.

**In Cursor's terminal (bottom panel), run:**

./core/migrations/v1-to-v2.sh

**Then come back here when it's done.**

[I've run the migration — continue]
[Show me what the migration does]
[Cancel update]
```

## Philosophy

**Automatic where possible:**
- Git commands run silently
- Conflicts resolved automatically
- Dependencies updated automatically
- Migrations run automatically (when safe)

**Interactive where necessary:**
- Breaking changes: confirm understanding
- Manual migration: clear instructions
- Errors: always offer restoration

**Safe always:**
- Backup created before any changes
- User data never at risk (gitignored)
- One-command rollback if issues
- Clear status at every step

**No jargon:**
- Don't say "merge conflict" - say "overlapping changes"
- Don't say "upstream" - say "main Dex repository"
- Don't say "git fetch" - say "downloading updates"
- Don't say "rebase" - just don't use rebase
