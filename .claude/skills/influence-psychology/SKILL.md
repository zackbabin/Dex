# Influence Psychology Framework

Framework for applying the science of persuasion ethically and effectively. Based on six decades of research into why people say "yes" and what makes them comply with requests.

## Core Principle

People don't make decisions rationally. They use mental shortcuts (heuristics) that can be triggered to influence behavior. These shortcuts evolved because they're usually reliable—but they can also be exploited.

**The foundation:** Understanding the psychological triggers that drive human compliance allows you to design products, messaging, and experiences that naturally align with how people actually make decisions.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating persuasive elements (features, copy, flows, campaigns), rate them 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means ethical, effective application of influence psychology; lower scores indicate missed opportunities or ethical concerns. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The Seven Principles of Influence

### 1. Reciprocity

**Core concept:** People feel obligated to give back to others who have given to them first.

**Why it works:** Humans are wired to avoid being indebted. The obligation to repay is so strong that it can overpower other factors like personal preference or fairness.

**Key insights:**
- The gift must come first (before the request)
- Personalization increases power
- Unexpected gifts are more powerful than expected ones
- Even small gifts create obligation
- The return favor often exceeds the original gift

**Product applications:**

| Context | Reciprocity Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Free trials** | Give full access first, then ask to pay | Spotify Premium trial → subscription |
| **Content marketing** | Provide value upfront (guides, tools) | HubSpot free CRM → paid tools |
| **Referral programs** | Give reward to both referrer and referee | Dropbox: both get extra storage |
| **Onboarding** | Unlock a premium feature temporarily | Grammarly: free tone detection trial |
| **SaaS** | Provide unexpected value or support | Personalized setup call for new users |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Here's a gift for you..." (before asking)
- "We've upgraded your account..."
- "As a thank you for signing up..."
- "We noticed you needed help with X, so we..."

**Ethical boundary:** Give genuine value. Don't create artificial debts or exploit obligation.

See: [references/reciprocity.md](references/reciprocity.md) for reciprocity techniques and case studies.

### 2. Commitment & Consistency

**Core concept:** People want to be consistent with their past statements, beliefs, and actions.

**Why it works:** Inconsistency is psychologically uncomfortable. Once we've made a choice or taken a stand, we encounter personal and interpersonal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment.

**Key insights:**
- Small initial commitments lead to larger ones (foot-in-the-door)
- Public commitments are stronger than private ones
- Written commitments are stronger than verbal ones
- Active commitments (user-generated) are stronger than passive ones
- Self-perception: we infer our attitudes from our behavior

**Product applications:**

| Context | Commitment Trigger | Example |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| **Onboarding** | Start with easy yes, build to larger asks | Duolingo: "Can you commit to 5 min/day?" |
| **Progressive profiling** | Small data requests that compound | LinkedIn: add photo → headline → experience |
| **Goal setting** | User publicly states a goal | Strava: "I want to run 50km this month" |
| **Social proof generation** | Ask for review after positive action | Airbnb: review request after good stay |
| **Habit formation** | Track streak publicly | Snapchat streaks, GitHub contributions |

**Copy patterns:**
- "What's your biggest challenge with X?" (commitment to a problem)
- "How much would you like to save per month?" (numerical commitment)
- "Would you like to join X people who've already...?"
- "You said you wanted to achieve X. Let's start with..."

**Onboarding sequence:**
1. Get micro-commitment ("What brings you here?")
2. Small action (click, choice, input)
3. Public or written commitment (goal, preference)
4. Reinforce consistency ("Based on what you told us...")

**Ethical boundary:** Don't lock users into commitments they didn't freely make. Allow easy reversibility.

See: [references/commitment-consistency.md](references/commitment-consistency.md) for commitment tactics and flows.

### 3. Social Proof

**Core concept:** People determine what's correct by finding out what other people think is correct.

**Why it works:** When uncertain, we look to others' behavior as a guide. "If everyone's doing it, it must be right."

**Key insights:**
- Most powerful when observers are uncertain
- Similar others = stronger proof (age, location, goals)
- Negative social proof can backfire ("9 out of 10 don't...")
- Specific numbers > vague claims ("2,347 users" > "thousands")
- Live activity = urgency + proof

**Types of social proof:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Wisdom of crowds** | Many people use/buy | "Join 50,000+ marketers" |
| **Wisdom of friends** | People you know use it | "3 of your friends use Notion" |
| **Expert** | Authorities endorse | "Recommended by Y Combinator" |
| **Celebrity** | Famous people use it | "Used by Elon Musk" |
| **Certification** | Third-party validation | "SOC 2 compliant", "App of the Year" |
| **User** | Similar people succeeded | "Startups like yours grew 10x" |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Social Proof Implementation | Example |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| **Landing pages** | User count, reviews, logos | "Trusted by 10,000+ companies" |
| **Signup flow** | Live signups, popular plans | "23 people signed up in the last hour" |
| **Feature adoption** | Show usage by others | "85% of teams use this feature" |
| **Urgency** | Limited availability | "Only 3 spots left at this price" |
| **Reviews** | Ratings, testimonials, case studies | G2 badges, video testimonials |

**Copy patterns:**
- "[X number] of [similar people] are already..."
- "[Name/Company] increased [metric] by [%]"
- "Don't take our word for it. Here's what [users] say..."
- "Join [X] others in [cohort]"

**Ethical boundary:** Never fabricate social proof. Real numbers, real testimonials. Disclose when proof is curated.

See: [references/social-proof.md](references/social-proof.md) for social proof types and implementation patterns.

### 4. Authority

**Core concept:** People follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts.

**Why it works:** Obedience to authority is deeply ingrained. Following experts is an efficient shortcut when we lack expertise ourselves.

**Key insights:**
- Titles, credentials, uniforms trigger automatic compliance
- Authority is conferred (doctors, professors) and assumed (confident tone)
- Admitting a weakness paradoxically increases authority (trustworthiness)
- Expertise in one domain doesn't transfer, but people assume it does
- Even symbols of authority work (lab coats, official-looking designs)

**Sources of authority:**

| Type | Signal | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Credentials** | Degrees, certifications | "Built by Stanford PhDs" |
| **Experience** | Years in field, track record | "20 years in cybersecurity" |
| **Social proof** | Awards, press, rankings | "Featured in Forbes, TechCrunch" |
| **Association** | Trusted partners, investors | "Backed by Y Combinator" |
| **Content** | Thought leadership, research | "Based on research with 10,000 users" |
| **Transparency** | Honest about limitations | "Works best for teams of 10-50" |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Authority Trigger | Example |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **About page** | Founder credentials, team expertise | "Built by ex-Google engineers" |
| **Content** | Original research, whitepapers | "State of [Industry] 2026 Report" |
| **Product UI** | Professional design, data citations | Charts with "Source: X Study" |
| **Support** | Expert consultations, certifications | "Talk to a certified expert" |
| **Partnerships** | Integration badges, security certs | "SOC 2 Type II", "GDPR compliant" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Trusted by [authority figure/company]"
- "Certified by [credible third party]"
- "Research shows that [cite source]..."
- "Our team includes [credentials]"

**Ethical use:**
- Admit weaknesses before strengths (increases trust)
- Be transparent about what you're not good at
- Cite real sources and data
- Don't overstate credentials or experience

**Ethical boundary:** Never fake credentials or fabricate expertise. Real authority only.

See: [references/authority.md](references/authority.md) for authority-building strategies.

### 5. Liking

**Core concept:** People prefer to say yes to those they like.

**Why it works:** We're more persuaded by people we like, trust, and feel connected to. Liking creates psychological safety and reduces resistance.

**Factors that increase liking:**

| Factor | Mechanism | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Physical attractiveness** | Halo effect: attractive = good | Professional headshots, polished design |
| **Similarity** | We like people like us | "I'm a founder just like you" |
| **Compliments** | Flattery works (even when obvious) | "You have great taste in tools" |
| **Cooperation** | Working toward shared goals | "Let's build this together" |
| **Familiarity** | Repeated exposure increases liking | Consistent brand, retargeting |
| **Association** | Linked to positive things | Product placement with aspirational lifestyles |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Liking Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Brand voice** | Friendly, conversational, human tone | Mailchimp's playful copy |
| **Team pages** | Show real people, personality | Personal bios, hobbies, photos |
| **Onboarding** | Personalized welcome, friendly UI | "Hey [Name], welcome!" |
| **Support** | Warm, empathetic responses | "I totally understand that frustration..." |
| **Community** | Facilitate connections among similar users | User groups, Slack communities |

**Copy patterns:**
- "We're [similar trait] just like you"
- "Great choice! You clearly value [shared value]"
- "We built this because we were frustrated with..."
- Use casual, warm language ("Hey", "Awesome!", "We got you")

**Ethical boundary:** Be genuinely helpful and authentic. Don't manufacture false rapport or manipulate emotions.

See: [references/liking.md](references/liking.md) for liking techniques and tone guidelines.

### 6. Scarcity

**Core concept:** People want more of what they can't have or what's running out.

**Why it works:** Loss aversion is stronger than gain seeking. The fear of missing out (FOMO) triggers urgency and desire.

**Key insights:**
- Scarcity of time > scarcity of quantity
- Newly scarce > always scarce (loss framing)
- Competition increases value (if others want it, I want it)
- Exclusive access is more valuable than open access
- Psychological reactance: when freedom is threatened, we want it more

**Types of scarcity:**

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Limited quantity** | Finite supply | "Only 5 seats left" |
| **Limited time** | Deadline pressure | "Offer ends Friday" |
| **Exclusive access** | Not everyone can have it | "Invite-only beta" |
| **Unique** | One-of-a-kind | "Custom built for you" |
| **Competition** | Others are competing for it | "12 people viewing this" |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Scarcity Trigger | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Pricing** | Limited-time discount | "Early bird pricing ends in 3 days" |
| **Features** | Beta access, waitlist | "Join 5,000 on the waitlist" |
| **Events** | Limited seats, RSVP deadlines | "Only 20 spots remaining" |
| **Inventory** | Stock levels | "2 left in stock" |
| **Urgency** | Countdown timers | Real-time countdown to deadline |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Limited to the first [X] customers"
- "Offer expires [specific date]"
- "Join the waitlist" (implies exclusivity)
- "[X] people are viewing this right now"

**Ethical boundaries:**
- **Never fake scarcity.** If there's no real limit, don't imply one.
- **Avoid dark patterns:** Reset timers, fake countdown clocks are manipulative.
- **Allow rational decisions:** Scarcity shouldn't prevent informed choice.

**When scarcity is ethical:**
- Real limited inventory (truthful stock counts)
- Genuine deadlines (actual event dates, seasonal offers)
- Legitimate exclusivity (beta capacity limits, cohort sizes)

**When scarcity is unethical:**
- Artificial scarcity (no real limit)
- Evergreen countdown timers that reset
- "Only 2 left!" repeated every day
- Pressuring vulnerable users

See: [references/scarcity.md](references/scarcity.md) for scarcity tactics and ethical implementation.

### 7. Unity

**Core concept:** People say yes to those they consider part of "us" (shared identity).

**Why it works:** Tribal identity is fundamental. We make sacrifices for in-group members we wouldn't make for strangers.

**Unity vs. Liking:**
- **Liking:** "This person is like me" (similarity)
- **Unity:** "This person is me" (shared identity)

**Sources of unity:**

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Family** | Blood relation, chosen family | "We're family" |
| **Place** | Hometown, region, nationality | "Built in San Francisco, for founders" |
| **Experience** | Shared hardship or triumph | "We've all struggled with bad CRMs" |
| **Values** | Deep beliefs, mission alignment | "For people who value privacy" |
| **Tribe** | Co-creation, movement | "Join the indie maker community" |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Unity Trigger | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Brand positioning** | Define the tribe | "For remote-first teams" |
| **Messaging** | "We" language, shared struggle | "We believe work should be flexible" |
| **Community** | Facilitate co-creation | User-generated content, forums |
| **Onboarding** | Identity affirmation | "Welcome to the [tribe name]" |
| **Social features** | Enable unity signals | Profile badges, group membership |

**Copy patterns:**
- "For [identity group]" ("For designers", "For bootstrappers")
- "Join [X] others who believe..."
- "We're building this together"
- "This is for us, not them"

**Ethical boundary:** Don't create toxic in-groups or vilify out-groups. Unity should unite, not divide maliciously.

See: [references/unity.md](references/unity.md) for unity-building strategies.

## Combining Principles

The most powerful persuasion uses multiple principles together.

**Example: SaaS landing page**
- **Authority:** "Built by ex-Stripe engineers" (credentials)
- **Social proof:** "Trusted by 5,000+ companies" (wisdom of crowds)
- **Liking:** Friendly, warm copy and design
- **Scarcity:** "Join the beta—limited spots available"
- **Reciprocity:** "Start free, no credit card required"
- **Unity:** "For founders who move fast"

**Example: Referral program**
- **Reciprocity:** Give reward to both parties
- **Social proof:** "X friends already joined"
- **Unity:** "Invite your team"
- **Commitment:** After they've had a good experience

## Ethical Application Checklist

Before deploying influence tactics:

- [ ] **Is it truthful?** No fake scarcity, fabricated proof, or false credentials
- [ ] **Does it help the user?** Persuasion should align with user goals, not exploit them
- [ ] **Is it transparent?** Are you hiding how you're influencing them?
- [ ] **Is it reversible?** Can users easily undo commitments?
- [ ] **Would you use it on yourself/family?** The golden rule of persuasion
- [ ] **Does it respect autonomy?** Users should feel in control, not manipulated
- [ ] **Are you targeting vulnerable groups?** Extra caution with children, elderly, desperate

**The line between persuasion and manipulation:**
- **Persuasion:** Helping people see value they'd appreciate anyway
- **Manipulation:** Tricking people into choices against their interests

See: [references/ethics.md](references/ethics.md) for comprehensive ethical boundaries.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Fake social proof** | Destroys trust when discovered | Use real data or don't use it |
| **Overuse of scarcity** | Becomes noise, loses power | Reserve for genuine urgency |
| **Inconsistent authority** | Undermines credibility | Don't claim expertise you lack |
| **Forced reciprocity** | Feels transactional, not genuine | Give without immediate ask |
| **Generic unity** | "Everyone" is not a tribe | Define specific shared identity |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any persuasive element:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Which principle(s) am I using? | You're relying on luck | Explicitly design for influence |
| Is this claim/tactic truthful? | You're manipulating | Remove or replace with truth |
| Would this work on me? | It probably won't work on others | Redesign with genuine value |
| Am I combining principles? | Missing leverage | Layer multiple principles |
| Can users easily reverse? | Ethical concern | Add clear opt-outs |
