# Grand Slam Offers: The Complete Assembly Process

A Grand Slam Offer is not a single product or service. It is a carefully assembled package of solutions that, taken together, address every obstacle between the customer and their Dream Outcome. The process of building one follows a systematic method: identify problems, create solutions, assign delivery vehicles, trim the low-value items, stack the high-value items, and package everything into an offer that is impossible to compare to anything else on the market.

This reference covers the complete assembly process from problem identification through final packaging.

## The Problem-Solution Mapping Process

### Step 1: List Every Problem

Before building solutions, you must exhaustively catalog every problem, fear, objection, and obstacle your prospect faces. The goal is completeness, not elegance. Write down everything, no matter how small.

**Problem categories to consider:**

| Category | What to Ask | Example Problems |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Before purchase** | What stops them from buying? | "I don't have the budget," "I've tried similar things before," "I don't have time" |
| **During experience** | What makes the process hard? | "I don't understand the technology," "I get overwhelmed," "I can't stay consistent" |
| **After result** | What happens after they succeed? | "What if it stops working?," "What if I can't maintain results?," "What's the next step?" |
| **External** | What outside forces create friction? | "My partner doesn't support this," "My team won't adopt it," "My industry is different" |
| **Internal** | What self-doubt or beliefs block them? | "I'm not technical enough," "I'm too old/young," "I don't have the right background" |

**The exhaustive problem list exercise:**
1. Set a 30-minute timer
2. Write down every problem your customer faces on the path to the Dream Outcome
3. Organize problems into the categories above
4. Interview 10 customers or prospects and add any problems they mention that you missed
5. Aim for 30-50 distinct problems

### Step 2: Create Solutions

For each problem on your list, create at least one solution. A solution is a specific answer to the problem -- not a vague assurance, but a concrete deliverable.

**Solution design principles:**
- Each solution should be independently valuable
- Solutions should be describable in one sentence
- The best solutions are ones the customer could not create on their own
- Prioritize solutions that address the most painful problems first

**Example problem-to-solution mapping:**

| Problem | Solution | Why It Works |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| "I don't have time to learn" | Done-for-you implementation | Eliminates effort entirely |
| "I've tried and failed before" | Step-by-step system with checkpoints | Increases Perceived Likelihood |
| "I don't know if it works for my industry" | Industry-specific case studies and templates | Reduces perceived risk |
| "I can't afford to pay all at once" | 3-payment plan with same total | Removes financial barrier |
| "What if I get stuck?" | Weekly Q&A calls for 90 days | Reduces Effort & Sacrifice |
| "I need results fast" | Quick-start guide with Day 1 action plan | Reduces Time Delay |

### Step 3: Assign Delivery Vehicles

Every solution needs a delivery vehicle -- the format or mechanism through which the solution reaches the customer. The delivery vehicle dramatically affects both the perceived value and the cost to deliver.

**Delivery vehicle spectrum:**

| Delivery Vehicle | Effort for Customer | Cost to Deliver | Perceived Value | Best For |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Done-for-you (DFY)** | None | Highest | Highest | Premium offers, agency clients |
| **Done-with-you (DWY)** | Low-Medium | High | Very High | Coaching, consulting, workshops |
| **Recorded course** | Medium | Low (one-time creation) | Medium | Scalable education, info products |
| **Templates/tools** | Low | Low | High (effort saved) | Any offer as a bonus or core |
| **Community/peer support** | Low | Low (ongoing moderation) | Medium-High | Retention, accountability |
| **Written guides/PDFs** | Medium | Lowest | Low-Medium | Supplements and bonuses |
| **Software/automation** | Low | Medium (development) | High | SaaS, tech-enabled services |
| **Live group calls** | Medium | Medium | High | Coaching programs, masterminds |

**Choosing the right delivery vehicle:**
- Match the vehicle to the problem: complex problems need high-touch vehicles
- Match the vehicle to the price point: $50 info products use courses; $50,000 services use DFY
- Mix vehicles within a single offer: core course + live calls + templates + community
- Use lower-cost vehicles for lower-priority problems (bonuses)

## The Trim & Stack Method

Not all solutions belong in the final offer. The Trim & Stack method separates high-impact, cost-effective solutions from expensive, low-impact ones.

### The Trim & Stack Matrix

Plot each solution on this 2x2 matrix:

| | High Value to Customer | Low Value to Customer |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Cost to Deliver** | **STACK** (include and highlight) | **CONSIDER** (include if it supports other elements) |
| **High Cost to Deliver** | **PREMIUM** (include in high-tier only) | **TRIM** (remove from the offer) |

**STACK quadrant (high value, low cost):** These are your power plays. Templates, recorded trainings, community access, swipe files, checklists, and digital tools. Include as many of these as possible. They cost you almost nothing but dramatically increase perceived value.

**PREMIUM quadrant (high value, high cost):** Done-for-you services, 1-on-1 coaching, custom development. Include these in your highest-priced tier or as the core of a premium offer. These are what justify the highest prices.

**CONSIDER quadrant (low value, low cost):** These do not move the needle much, but if they cost nothing, they can pad the offer. PDF guides, basic email sequences, simple checklists. Use sparingly to avoid diluting the offer.

**TRIM quadrant (low value, high cost):** Cut these ruthlessly. They drain your margin without meaningfully increasing conversions. Examples: unlimited 1-on-1 support for a low-ticket product, custom deliverables for every customer at scale.

### Applying the Trim & Stack Matrix: Example

A fitness coaching business selling a 12-week transformation program:

| Solution | Customer Value | Delivery Cost | Decision |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Custom workout plan | High | Medium (template + personalize) | STACK (systematize it) |
| 1-on-1 weekly calls | High | High | PREMIUM (limit spots) |
| Meal prep video library | High | Low (record once) | STACK |
| Grocery shopping list | Medium | Low (template) | STACK |
| Private Facebook group | High | Low (moderate 30 min/day) | STACK |
| Custom supplement protocol | Low | High (requires research per person) | TRIM |
| Printed recipe book mailed to home | Medium | High (printing + shipping) | TRIM |
| Kitchen equipment guide PDF | Low | Low | CONSIDER |
| Weekly group Q&A call | High | Medium | STACK |
| Progress photo review | High | Low (2 min per person) | STACK |

Result: The core offer includes the custom workout plan, meal prep videos, grocery lists, Facebook group, weekly group Q&A, and progress photo reviews. The 1-on-1 calls are reserved for a premium tier. The supplement protocol and printed recipe book are trimmed. The kitchen equipment guide is included as a minor bonus.

## Offer Tiers and Packaging

### Creating Multiple Tiers

Most Grand Slam Offers benefit from 2-3 tiers. Each tier serves a different customer segment:

| Tier | Target | Core Components | Price Range |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **DIY (Self-Guided)** | Budget-conscious, self-starters | Course + templates + community | $297-$997 |
| **DWY (Done-With-You)** | Want guidance and accountability | Everything in DIY + coaching calls + feedback | $2,000-$10,000 |
| **DFY (Done-For-You)** | Want results without effort | Everything in DWY + implementation | $10,000-$100,000+ |

**Tier design principles:**
- Each tier must feel complete (no one should feel cheated at any level)
- Higher tiers add speed, ease, and personal attention -- not content
- Price jumps between tiers should feel proportional to the value added
- The middle tier is typically where most customers land (the "decoy effect" drives this)

### The Decoy Effect in Offer Tiers

When you present three options, the middle option becomes the most popular because:
- The low tier feels "too basic"
- The high tier feels "too expensive"
- The middle tier feels "just right"

You can use this deliberately by making the middle tier your ideal customer outcome and pricing the other tiers to push people toward it.

## Assembling the Final Offer

### The Offer Stack Presentation

Present your offer as a stack of individually valuable components:

```
CORE OFFER: [Name] — $[Value]
  [Description of the main deliverable]

BONUS 1: [Name] — $[Value]
  [Description addressing Objection #1]

BONUS 2: [Name] — $[Value]
  [Description addressing Objection #2]

BONUS 3: [Name] — $[Value]
  [Description addressing Objection #3]

BONUS 4: [Name] — $[Value]
  [Description addressing Objection #4]

GUARANTEE: [Named Guarantee]
  [Specific terms of risk reversal]

TOTAL VALUE: $[Sum of all components]
YOUR INVESTMENT: $[Price]
```

### Value Stack Arithmetic

The sum of all individually priced components should be at least 10x the asking price:

| Component | Assigned Value |
|-----------|---------------|
| Core Program (12-Week Accelerator) | $5,000 |
| Bonus 1: Template Library | $1,500 |
| Bonus 2: Private Community (1 year) | $2,400 |
| Bonus 3: Weekly Q&A Recordings | $3,600 |
| Bonus 4: Quick-Start Implementation Guide | $500 |
| **Total Value** | **$13,000** |
| **Your Price** | **$997** |
| **Value-to-Price Ratio** | **13:1** |

### The "Everything They Need, Nothing They Don't" Test

Before finalizing, run this test on every component:

- [ ] Does this component directly help the customer achieve the Dream Outcome?
- [ ] Does this component address a specific, identified problem or objection?
- [ ] Can I deliver this component at a cost that maintains healthy margins?
- [ ] Would removing this component meaningfully reduce the offer's appeal?
- [ ] Can I assign a defensible dollar value to this component?

If any component fails 3 or more of these checks, consider removing it. A focused, valuable offer beats a bloated, overwhelming one.

## Common Assembly Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The "Everything Buffet"

Including everything you could possibly offer regardless of relevance. This overwhelms the prospect and dilutes perceived value. A buffet is not a Grand Slam Offer -- it is a mess.

**Fix:** Only include components that pass the 5-check test above.

### Mistake 2: The "Feature Dump"

Listing features instead of outcomes. "50 video lessons" means nothing. "Step-by-step system that gets you from zero to first client in 14 days" means everything.

**Fix:** For every component, state the outcome it delivers, not the format it takes.

### Mistake 3: The "Missing Middle"

Creating a great core product but no bonuses or support to ensure success. This creates a gap between purchase and result that the customer must cross alone.

**Fix:** Map every gap between purchase and result. Fill each gap with a solution.

### Mistake 4: The "One-Size Offer"

Offering only one tier when your market has clearly different segments (budget vs. premium, DIY vs. done-for-you). You lose both ends.

**Fix:** Create 2-3 tiers that serve distinct customer segments.

### Mistake 5: Inconsistent Delivery Vehicles

Promising high-touch results with low-touch delivery. If you promise transformation, a PDF alone will not get the customer there.

**Fix:** Match delivery vehicles to the promises you make. If you charge premium, deliver premium.
