# Bonuses and Value Stacking: Making the Offer Irresistible

Bonuses are the secret weapon of a Grand Slam Offer. They are not afterthoughts or throwaways -- they are strategically designed components that address specific objections, increase perceived value, and tip the decision in your favor. When done correctly, the total value of the bonuses alone exceeds the price of the offer, making the core product feel free. This reference covers the bonus design framework, dollar value assignment, stacking strategies, partner bonuses, and naming tactics.

## The Bonus Design Framework

### Purpose of Each Bonus

Every bonus in a Grand Slam Offer must serve one of these purposes:

| Purpose | What It Does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Address an objection** | Removes a specific reason not to buy | Objection: "I'm not technical." Bonus: "Tech Setup Guide: Step-by-Step Walkthrough" |
| **Reduce Time Delay** | Helps the customer get results faster | "Quick-Start Kit: Your First Campaign in 24 Hours" |
| **Reduce Effort** | Makes the process easier | "47 Copy-Paste Email Templates" |
| **Increase Perceived Likelihood** | Provides proof or support that increases confidence | "Case Study Library: 30 Success Stories from People Like You" |
| **Increase Dream Outcome** | Adds an additional desirable result | "Bonus Module: How to Scale from $10K to $50K Months" |

### The Bonus Design Process

**Step 1: List remaining objections.** After you have built your core offer and guarantee, what objections remain? Common categories:

- "I don't have enough time" (need: speed, efficiency, done-for-you elements)
- "I don't have the skills" (need: training, templates, step-by-step guides)
- "I've tried this before and it didn't work" (need: proof, support, accountability)
- "What if I get stuck?" (need: access to help, community, troubleshooting)
- "This won't work for my specific situation" (need: customization, industry-specific content)
- "I can't justify the cost" (need: ROI calculator, case studies, payment plans)

**Step 2: Create one bonus per objection.** Each bonus should directly neutralize the objection. If the objection is "I don't have enough time," the bonus should literally save them time (templates, automation, done-for-you components).

**Step 3: Choose the delivery vehicle.** Bonuses should be high value and low cost to deliver. The ideal bonus is a digital asset that you create once and deliver infinitely.

**Ideal bonus delivery vehicles:**
- PDF guides, checklists, and workbooks
- Pre-built templates and swipe files
- Recorded video trainings
- Software tools or calculators
- Community access
- Recorded workshops or masterclasses
- Curated resource lists
- Assessment tools and scorecards

**Delivery vehicles to avoid for bonuses (high cost, hard to scale):**
- Unlimited 1-on-1 time
- Custom physical products
- Anything requiring per-customer labor at scale

## How to Assign Dollar Values

### The Three Methods

Every bonus needs a dollar value. This value appears in your offer stack and contributes to the total perceived value. The value must be honest and defensible.

**Method 1: Market Price Comparison**

What would someone pay for this on the open market?

| Bonus | Market Comparison | Assigned Value |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Template library (50 templates) | Similar template packs sell for $197-$497 | $297 |
| Recorded masterclass (2 hours) | Online courses of similar length sell for $197-$997 | $497 |
| Private community (1 year) | Similar communities charge $49-$199/month | $1,188 ($99/mo x 12) |
| Assessment tool | Consultants charge $500-$2,000 for similar assessments | $750 |

**Method 2: Time-to-Create Calculation**

How much time and expertise went into creating this, and what would it cost to hire someone to create it?

| Bonus | Creation Investment | Assigned Value |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Swipe file of 100 winning ads | 40 hours of research + design at $150/hr | $997 (rounded from $6,000 to remain credible) |
| Legal contract templates (5 templates) | 10 hours of attorney time at $400/hr | $2,000 |
| Custom spreadsheet with 20 formulas | 15 hours of development at $100/hr | $500 |

**Method 3: Outcome Value**

What is the result of using this bonus worth to the customer?

| Bonus | Outcome | Assigned Value |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Lead generation template that generates 10 leads | 10 leads x $500 average value = $5,000 | $997 (conservative fraction of outcome) |
| Hiring scorecard that prevents one bad hire | Average cost of a bad hire: $15,000 | $1,500 |
| Tax optimization guide that saves $3,000-$10,000 | Direct savings | $2,000 |

### Dollar Value Guidelines

- **Be honest.** The value should be what someone would actually pay. If you would not buy it at that price, neither would anyone else.
- **Be specific.** "$297 value" is more believable than "$300 value" because specificity implies precision.
- **Be conservative.** Slightly understating value is better than obviously overstating it. Credibility is more important than a big number.
- **Round down, not up.** If the calculated value is $1,274, use $997 or $1,200. Never round up to $1,500.
- **Use odd numbers.** $497, $997, $1,297 feel more researched than $500, $1,000, $1,300.

## Stacking Order Strategies

The order in which you present bonuses affects their perceived value and the overall persuasive impact of the offer.

### Strategy 1: Descending Value (Anchor High)

Present the most valuable bonus first. This sets an anchor that makes subsequent bonuses feel like additional windfalls.

**When to use:** When you have one standout bonus that is clearly more valuable than the others. The big number at the top sets the tone.

**Example:**
1. Bonus 1: Private Coaching Call Library (52 recordings) -- $4,997 value
2. Bonus 2: Template Vault (100+ templates) -- $1,997 value
3. Bonus 3: Quick-Start Implementation Kit -- $997 value
4. Bonus 4: Resource Guide and Tool Recommendations -- $297 value

### Strategy 2: Ascending Value (Build to a Climax)

Start with smaller bonuses and build to the biggest one. This creates a sense of escalating generosity that peaks right before the price reveal.

**When to use:** On sales calls, webinars, and live presentations where you control the pacing. The "and wait, there's more" effect builds excitement.

**Example:**
1. Bonus 1: Quick-Reference Cheat Sheet -- $97 value
2. Bonus 2: Swipe File Collection -- $497 value
3. Bonus 3: Monthly Group Coaching (12 months) -- $2,400 value
4. Bonus 4: Done-For-You Campaign Setup -- $5,000 value

### Strategy 3: Objection Sequence

Order bonuses by the sequence in which objections arise in the buyer's mind. Address the most common objection first, the second most common next, and so on.

**When to use:** On sales pages where the reader processes information linearly. Each bonus neutralizes the next objection in the reader's mind.

**Example:**
1. Bonus 1 (addresses "I don't have time"): Quick-Start Templates -- $497 value
2. Bonus 2 (addresses "I'm not technical"): Tech Setup Video Walkthroughs -- $997 value
3. Bonus 3 (addresses "What if I get stuck?"): 90-Day Support Access -- $1,500 value
4. Bonus 4 (addresses "Will this work in my industry?"): Industry Case Studies -- $750 value

## Partner and Affiliate Bonuses

Partner bonuses allow you to add high-value components to your offer at zero cost to you. They are one of the most powerful and underutilized tactics in offer creation.

### How Partner Bonuses Work

1. Identify complementary products or services your customers also need
2. Approach those businesses and propose a partnership
3. They provide their product/service as a bonus in your offer
4. In return, they get exposure to your customer base (and often, the customer becomes their customer too)

### Finding Partner Bonus Opportunities

| Your Offer | Complementary Partner | Partner Bonus |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Marketing coaching | Email marketing software | 3-month free subscription ($297 value) |
| Fitness program | Supplement company | $50 store credit + free shaker bottle ($75 value) |
| Business course | Accounting software | 6-month free plan ($354 value) |
| Agency services | Stock photo service | 1-year premium access ($199 value) |
| SaaS product | Integration partner | Free premium integration setup ($500 value) |

### Approaching Partners

**The pitch framework:**
- "I have [X] customers in [niche] who are a perfect fit for your product."
- "I'd like to include [your product] as a bonus in my offer, which would introduce you to [X] qualified prospects."
- "In return, I'll feature you prominently and your product will be positioned as a [$value] bonus."
- "This is a win-win: my customers get more value, your product gets qualified exposure."

**Tips:**
- Approach partners whose product you genuinely recommend
- Make it easy: provide the copy, graphics, and positioning you will use
- Start with smaller partners who are eager for exposure
- Track how many partner-bonus users convert to paying customers of the partner (data makes future partnerships easier)

## Bonus Naming Strategies

A named bonus feels more real, more valuable, and more proprietary than a generic description. "Email templates" is forgettable. "The Inbox Domination Swipe File" is memorable.

### Naming Formulas

| Formula | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **The [Adjective] [Asset Type]** | Descriptive + deliverable | "The Ultimate Email Template Vault" |
| **The [Result] [Container]** | Outcome + format | "The 6-Figure Launch Playbook" |
| **[Number] [Asset]** | Quantity + deliverable | "47 Proven Ad Scripts" |
| **The [Name] Method/System** | Branded + approach | "The Velocity Onboarding System" |
| **[Avatar]'s [Asset]** | Identity + deliverable | "The Founder's Financial Dashboard" |
| **[Speed] [Result] [Container]** | Timeframe + outcome + format | "The 7-Day Pipeline Accelerator" |

### Naming Dos and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Use specific numbers (47 templates, not "many templates")
- Include the result in the name (what they get, not what it is)
- Make it sound proprietary (use "The" as a definite article)
- Keep it concise (5-8 words maximum)
- Test names with your audience

**Don't:**
- Use vague, generic names ("Resource Library," "Bonus Materials")
- Make the name longer than the description
- Use jargon the customer does not understand
- Name it something that sounds cheap ("Free PDF," "Extra Stuff")
- Reuse the same naming pattern for every bonus

## Bonus Stacking Checklist

Before finalizing your bonus stack, run through this checklist:

- [ ] Does each bonus address a specific, identified objection?
- [ ] Does each bonus have a clear, defensible dollar value?
- [ ] Are the bonuses high-value/low-cost to deliver?
- [ ] Does the total bonus value exceed the price of the offer?
- [ ] Does the total bonus value plus core offer value equal at least 10x the price?
- [ ] Is each bonus named distinctively?
- [ ] Are there 3-7 bonuses (not too few, not overwhelming)?
- [ ] Do the bonuses cover different objection categories (time, skill, support, proof)?
- [ ] Is there at least one partner bonus if possible?
- [ ] Would you personally find these bonuses valuable if you were the customer?

## Common Bonus Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Quantity Over Quality

Adding 15 mediocre bonuses to make the stack look impressive. This dilutes perceived quality and overwhelms the prospect.

**Fix:** 3-5 excellent bonuses beat 15 mediocre ones. Each bonus should be something you could sell on its own.

### Mistake 2: Inflated Values

Assigning a $10,000 value to a 3-page PDF. The prospect knows it is not worth that, and now they question all your other claims.

**Fix:** Use the three valuation methods above. When in doubt, undervalue rather than overvalue.

### Mistake 3: Irrelevant Bonuses

Adding bonuses that do not relate to the core offer or Dream Outcome. "Buy our marketing course and get a free meditation guide!" The mismatch creates confusion.

**Fix:** Every bonus must connect directly to the customer's journey from current state to Dream Outcome.

### Mistake 4: No Bonus Names

Listing bonuses as "Template library" or "Video training" without a distinctive name. Generic descriptions feel generic.

**Fix:** Name every bonus using the formulas above. A name implies intentional creation and standalone value.

### Mistake 5: Bonuses That Compete with the Core Offer

If the bonus is better than or replaces the core offer, the customer wonders why they are paying for the core at all.

**Fix:** Bonuses should complement and support the core offer, not replace it. They fill gaps, not overlap.
