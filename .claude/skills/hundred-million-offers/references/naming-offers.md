# Naming Your Offer: The MAGIC Formula

The name of your offer is the first thing a prospect sees and the last thing they remember. A great name pre-qualifies the right audience, communicates the outcome, creates curiosity, and makes the offer memorable. A mediocre name requires explanation, wastes attention, and makes marketing harder. Naming is the single most testable and improvable element of any offer -- a name change alone has been known to double conversion rates.

This reference covers the MAGIC formula in detail, provides 20+ real examples across industries, explains A/B testing strategies for offer names, and lists the naming dos and don'ts.

## The MAGIC Formula

MAGIC is an acronym for the five elements that make a compelling offer name:

### M -- Make a Magnetic Reason Why

The magnetic reason gives the offer a hook -- a reason for its existence that creates curiosity or relevance. It answers the question: "Why does this offer exist right now?"

**Types of magnetic reasons:**

| Type | What It Does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Event-driven** | Tied to a specific moment | "New Year Launch Sprint" |
| **Seasonal** | Tied to a season or cycle | "Summer Revenue Accelerator" |
| **Trend-driven** | Tied to a market shift | "The AI-Proof Business Builder" |
| **Problem-driven** | Tied to a widespread pain | "The Cash Flow Crisis Kit" |
| **Milestone** | Tied to a company or industry milestone | "10th Anniversary Founders Package" |
| **Scarcity-driven** | Tied to limited availability | "The Final Cohort Blueprint" |

**Tips:**
- The magnetic reason creates an implied urgency without needing a countdown timer
- Seasonal and event-driven reasons feel natural and non-manipulative
- Trend-driven reasons position you as forward-thinking
- Not every name needs a magnetic reason -- use it when it adds value

### A -- Announce Your Avatar

The avatar is who the offer is for. The more specific the avatar, the more magnetic the name is to the right people (and the less it appeals to the wrong people -- which is a feature, not a bug).

**Levels of avatar specificity:**

| Level | Example | Magnetism |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Generic** | "Entrepreneurs" | Weak -- too broad, no one self-selects |
| **Demographic** | "Women Entrepreneurs" | Moderate -- some self-selection |
| **Psychographic** | "Ambitious Women Entrepreneurs" | Better -- emotional resonance |
| **Behavioral** | "Women Entrepreneurs at $100K Struggling to Hit $500K" | Strong -- very specific pain + identity |
| **Identity** | "The Multi-Passionate Female Founder" | Very Strong -- they see themselves in the name |

**Tips:**
- Use language your avatar uses to describe themselves
- A name that repels the wrong people is just as valuable as one that attracts the right people
- The avatar in the name does not have to be exhaustive -- it just needs to be enough for self-selection
- Test multiple avatar descriptors to see which converts best

### G -- Give Them a Goal

The goal is the Dream Outcome expressed in concrete terms. It answers: "What will I achieve?"

**Goal framing techniques:**

| Technique | Example | Why It Works |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Specific metric** | "Add $100K in Revenue" | Quantifiable, measurable, tangible |
| **Transformation** | "From Freelancer to CEO" | Before/after identity shift |
| **Status** | "6-Figure Consultant" | Aspirational identity |
| **Negative elimination** | "Never Cold Call Again" | Removes the pain |
| **Capability** | "Master Facebook Ads" | Skill acquisition |
| **State** | "Fully Booked" | Desired condition |

**Tips:**
- Use the customer's words for the goal, not industry jargon
- Make the goal aspirational but believable
- Specificity beats abstraction ("$10K/month" beats "financial freedom")
- The goal should be the reason someone would buy, distilled into a phrase

### I -- Indicate a Time Frame

The time frame tells the prospect how fast they will get the result. It answers: "How long will this take?"

**Time frame options:**

| Time Frame | Perception | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **7 days** | Explosive, "quick win" | Simple, focused sprints |
| **14 days** | Fast, achievable | Intensive workshops, challenges |
| **30 days** | One-month commitment, serious | Most common for courses/programs |
| **60 days** | Substantial, dedicated | Multi-phase programs |
| **90 days** | One quarter, business-appropriate | B2B, consulting, comprehensive programs |
| **120 days** | Four months, significant transformation | Coaching programs, major skill development |
| **12 months** | Year-long commitment | Mastermind groups, annual programs |

**Tips:**
- Shorter time frames increase urgency but must be realistic
- The time frame should match the actual expected result timeline
- Use the shortest honest time frame
- "In 90 Days" is more compelling than "Over 3 Months" (same thing, different framing)
- You can indicate time frame for the "first result" (quick win) rather than the full result

### C -- Complete with a Container Word

The container word tells the prospect the format of the offer. It answers: "What am I buying?"

**Container word options:**

| Container Word | Implied Format | Perceived Value | Best For |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Challenge** | Short, intense, group-based | Medium | Lead generation, low-ticket |
| **Workshop** | Interactive, hands-on, time-bounded | Medium-High | Skill building, mid-ticket |
| **Blueprint** | Detailed plan, step-by-step | High | Info products, strategic offers |
| **System** | Comprehensive, proven methodology | Very High | Premium courses, consulting |
| **Accelerator** | Fast-paced, results-focused | Very High | Coaching, high-ticket |
| **Masterclass** | Expert-level, in-depth | High | Courses, premium education |
| **Bootcamp** | Intensive, immersive, transformation | High | Training programs |
| **Formula** | Proven, repeatable, scientific | High | Methodologies, frameworks |
| **Playbook** | Actionable, tactical, ready-to-use | Medium-High | Guides, tactical offers |
| **Academy** | Comprehensive, ongoing, educational | High | Membership, subscription courses |
| **Intensive** | Short, focused, high-energy | High | Weekend or week-long programs |
| **Lab** | Experimental, cutting-edge, innovative | Medium-High | Innovation-focused programs |
| **Vault** | Collection, comprehensive, valuable | Medium | Resource libraries, template packs |
| **Suite** | All-in-one, complete, professional | High | Software bundles, service packages |

**Tips:**
- The container word sets expectations for format and effort
- "Accelerator" implies speed. "System" implies comprehensiveness. Choose based on your positioning.
- Avoid overused container words in your industry (if everyone has a "masterclass," call yours a "system")
- The container word subtly communicates price tier: "Challenge" sounds free-to-cheap. "Accelerator" sounds premium.

## A/B Testing Offer Names

### What to Test

| Variable | Test Approach | Example A vs. B |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Avatar specificity** | Broad vs. narrow | "For Entrepreneurs" vs. "For E-Commerce Founders Doing $1M+" |
| **Goal framing** | Metric vs. transformation | "Add $100K in Revenue" vs. "From Struggling to Scaling" |
| **Time frame** | Shorter vs. longer | "In 30 Days" vs. "In 90 Days" |
| **Container word** | Different format implications | "Blueprint" vs. "Accelerator" vs. "System" |
| **Magnetic reason** | Different hooks | "New Year" vs. "AI-Powered" vs. "Recession-Proof" |
| **Complete name** | Two entirely different names | "The 6-Figure Blueprint" vs. "The Client Flood System" |

### How to Test

**Method 1: Ad headline testing.** Run the same ad with different offer names as headlines. The name with the highest click-through rate wins.

**Method 2: Landing page split test.** Create two identical landing pages with different offer names. Split traffic 50/50 and measure conversion rate.

**Method 3: Email subject line test.** Send the same email to two segments with different offer names in the subject line. Higher open rate = better name.

**Method 4: Social media poll.** Post two name options and ask your audience to vote. Quick and directional, though not as rigorous as a conversion test.

**Method 5: Sales conversation test.** On sales calls, alternate between two names. Track which one generates more interest and fewer clarifying questions.

### Testing Best Practices

- Test one variable at a time (change the container word, not the entire name)
- Run each test for at least 100 impressions per variant (more is better)
- The winning name is the one that generates higher conversion, not higher clicks
- After finding a winner, test it against a new challenger
- Revisit naming every 6-12 months as your market evolves

## Naming Dos and Don'ts

### Dos

- **Do use specific numbers.** "47 Templates" beats "Many Templates." Numbers create concreteness.
- **Do lead with the outcome.** The prospect cares about what they get, not what you made.
- **Do make it say-able.** If someone can't easily tell a friend the name of your offer, it's too complex.
- **Do test before committing.** A name is a hypothesis. Test it like any other marketing element.
- **Do use "The" as a definite article.** "The Revenue Accelerator" sounds more established than "Revenue Accelerator."
- **Do check for trademark conflicts.** Before finalizing, search USPTO and Google for conflicts.
- **Do keep it under 10 words.** Brevity is power. The name should fit in a headline.
- **Do make it sound proprietary.** A name that sounds like it belongs to you (not a generic category) differentiates.

### Don'ts

- **Don't use jargon your customer doesn't know.** "The Omnichannel Attribution Optimizer" means nothing to a small business owner.
- **Don't make the name longer than 10 words.** If you need 15 words, you're trying to say too much.
- **Don't use the same container word as all your competitors.** If every competitor has a "masterclass," call yours a "system" or "accelerator."
- **Don't name it after yourself (unless you're the brand).** "Mike's Marketing Program" is forgettable unless Mike is famous.
- **Don't use vague, generic names.** "Business Growth Program" could be anything. Specificity is magnetism.
- **Don't promise what you can't deliver.** "The Guaranteed Millionaire Maker" is unethical if your average customer doesn't become a millionaire.
- **Don't change names mid-campaign.** Once launched, commit to the name for the duration of the campaign. Test between campaigns.
- **Don't use punctuation that breaks URLs or hashtags.** Apostrophes, ampersands, and special characters create technical problems.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: MAGIC Worksheet

Fill in each element for your offer:
- M (Magnetic reason why): _______________
- A (Avatar): _______________
- G (Goal): _______________
- I (Time frame): _______________
- C (Container word): _______________

Combine them into 5 different name variations. Read each aloud. Which one would make your ideal customer stop scrolling?

### Exercise 2: Name Audit

Write down the names of your 5 closest competitors' offers. For each, identify which MAGIC elements are present and which are missing. Create a name for your offer that fills the gaps they leave.

### Exercise 3: The "Tell a Friend" Test

Say your offer name to 5 people who are not in your industry. Ask them: "What do you think this is?" and "Who do you think this is for?" If they can answer both correctly, your name is working.

### Exercise 4: 20 Names in 20 Minutes

Set a timer for 20 minutes. Write 20 different names for your offer, no filtering. After the timer, circle the top 3. Combine elements from multiple names to create the final candidate.

### Exercise 5: Industry Name Bank

Collect 30 offer names from successful businesses in adjacent industries (not your direct competitors). Study patterns. What container words do they use? How do they frame goals? Adapt the best patterns for your offer.
