description: Scan active projects for status, blockers, and next steps
---

Quick scan of all active projects to see what's stalled, blocked, or needs attention.

## What This Does

Checks each project in `04-Projects/` for:
1. Activity levels (when was project last touched?)
2. Week Priorities presence (does project have active tasks?)
3. Blockers (anything blocking progress?)
4. Next steps clarity (is the next action clear?)

## Process

### Step 1: Scan Projects

List all projects in `04-Projects/`:
```bash
ls -la 04-Projects/
```

### Step 2: Check Each Project

For each project folder or file:

**Activity Check:**
- Get last modification time
- >7 days without activity = yellow
- >14 days without activity = red

**Week Priorities Presence:**
- Scan `00-Inbox/Weekly_Plans.md` for project mentions
- No tasks for 2+ weeks = yellow

**Blocker Check:**
- Look for "blocked", "waiting on", "stuck" in project notes
- Any logged blocker = red

**Next Step Clarity:**
- Check if there's a clear next action
- No next step = yellow

### Step 3: Output Dashboard

```markdown
### Project Health Dashboard

| Project | Status | Issue | Days Since Activity |
|---------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| [Project A] | 🟢 | On track | 2 |
| [Project B] | 🟡 | No active tasks | 8 |
| [Project C] | 🔴 | Blocked - waiting on [X] | 15 |

**Summary:** [N] projects ([X] 🟢 / [Y] 🟡 / [Z] 🔴)
```

## Status Meanings

- 🟢 **Green**: Active, clear next steps, no blockers
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Stale 7-14 days, OR no active tasks, OR unclear next step
- 🔴 **Red**: Blocked, OR stale 14+ days

## When to Use

- Weekly planning to check project health
- When feeling disconnected from the big picture
- Before 1:1s to surface blocked projects
- When deciding what to work on next

## Follow-up Actions

For yellow projects:
- Add a task to Week Priorities
- Clarify next step in project notes

For red projects:
- Identify what's blocking progress
- Escalate if needed
- Or decide to pause/archive the project

## Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark project health check as used.

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `project_health_checked` and properties:
- projects_reviewed
- blockers_found

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".
