Toggle demo mode on/off, reset demo content, or launch interactive demo selector.

## Usage

- `/dex-demo on` - Enable demo mode and launch interactive demo selector
- `/dex-demo off` - Disable demo mode
- `/dex-demo menu` - Show demo scenario menu (when demo mode is on)
- `/dex-demo status` - Check current mode
- `/dex-demo reset` - Restore demo content to original state

## What Demo Mode Does

When demo mode is ON:
- Commands read/write from `System/Demo/` instead of your real vault
- You see pre-populated content for a fictional PM named "Alex Chen"
- Your real data is untouched
- Changes you make are sandboxed to the demo folder

When demo mode is OFF:
- Normal operation - commands use your real vault data

## Process

4. Display welcome message introducing Alex Chen persona

3. If yes, display the same interactive menu from above (scenarios 1-12)
4. Wait for user to select a number

### For `/dex-demo off`

1. Read `System/user-profile.yaml`
2. Set `demo_mode: false`
3. Write back to file
4. Confirm: "Demo mode disabled. You're now using your real vault data."

### For `/dex-demo status`

1. Read `System/user-profile.yaml`
2. Check `demo_mode` value
3. Report current status with brief context

### For `/dex-demo reset`

1. Check if `System/Demo/_original/` exists
2. If not, error: "Demo backup not found. Cannot reset."
3. If exists, copy all from `_original/` to parent Demo folder
4. Confirm: "Demo content reset! All changes reverted to original demo state."

## Executing Demo Scenarios

When user selects a scenario number (1-12):

1. Read `.claude/reference/demo-scenarios.md` to get scenario details
2. Execute the scenario according to its definition:
   - For scenarios with commands to RUN: Execute those commands and provide guided walkthrough
   - For scenarios with files to SHOW: Read and display those files with talking points
   - For scenarios with both: Show files first, then run commands
3. After scenario completes, display the full menu again with: "Try another scenario? Enter a number (1-12):"

**Scenario execution guidelines:**

- **Scenarios 1-4, 7-8, 11-12:** Run the actual commands (`/journal`, `/daily-plan`, `/review`, `/triage`, `/week-plan`, `/week-review`, `/career-coach`, `/dex-backlog`, `/dex-whats-new`)
- **Scenarios 5-6, 9-10:** Read and display files with talking points, don't run commands
- Provide context before and after each action
- Reference the scenario's "Talking points" to guide the walkthrough
- Keep narration concise but informative

## Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark demo mode as used.

Call `track_event` with event_name `demo_mode_used` (no properties).

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".
