description: Capture learnings from completed work for future reference
---

Capture what you learned from completing work. This is the "compound" step—making future similar work easier.

## Arguments

$WORK_COMPLETED: What did you just complete? (project milestone, tricky problem, meeting, workflow improvement, etc.)

## Process

### 1. Reflection Questions

Ask the user (or extract from recent work context):

1. **What was the situation?**
   - Original goal or challenge
   - Why it was harder than expected (if applicable)

2. **What approach worked?**
   - Strategy or tactic used
   - Key decisions made

3. **What would you do differently?**
   - Gotchas encountered
   - Better approaches discovered late

4. **What's reusable?**
   - Patterns that apply elsewhere
   - Mental models that help

### 2. Create or Update Learning Note

Store in: `06-Resources/Learnings/[Category]_Learnings.md`

**Categories:**
- `Working_Preferences` - How you like to work, communication style, tool preferences
- `Mistake_Patterns` - Common errors to avoid, with triggers and corrections

Create new category files as needed for domain-specific learnings.

### 3. Learning Entry Format

Append to the appropriate file:

```markdown
---

## [Short Title] — [Date]

**Context:** [1 sentence on what you were doing]

**Challenge:** [What was tricky or non-obvious]

**What Worked:** 
[The approach that succeeded]

**Key Insight:** 
> [The memorable takeaway—something you'd tell past-you]

**See Also:** [Related notes if any]
```

### 4. Cross-Link (Optional)

If the learning relates to:
- A person → Add to their person page
- A project → Add link in project's note
- A recurring workflow → Update relevant template

## Output

1. Ask reflection questions (or extract from context)
2. Create/update the appropriate learning file
3. Suggest any cross-links
4. Confirm saved

## Philosophy

> "The palest ink is better than the best memory." — Chinese proverb

This isn't documentation for others—it's a gift to future-you. 
Be specific. Include the gotcha. Make it searchable.

## Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark learning capture as used.

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `insight_saved` and properties:
- category

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".
