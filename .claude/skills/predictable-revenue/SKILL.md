# Predictable Revenue Framework

A systematic approach to building a scalable, predictable B2B sales machine. Pioneered the outbound prospecting system that helped Salesforce add $100M in recurring revenue.

## Core Principle

**Predictable lead generation drives predictable revenue.** The biggest mistake in sales is having the same people prospect AND close. Specialization creates a repeatable, scalable machine.

**The foundation:** Cold calling is dead. Cold Calling 2.0 — mass, personalized cold emails that generate referrals to the right person — is the new outbound. Combined with sales role specialization, this creates predictable, scalable revenue.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When evaluating or building a sales process, rate 0-10 based on predictability, specialization, and process maturity. A 10/10 means clear role separation, repeatable prospecting process, and predictable pipeline generation; lower scores indicate ad-hoc sales or reliance on heroics. Always provide current score and improvements to reach 10/10.

## The Three Types of Leads

**Not all leads are created equal. Treat them differently.**

| Type | Source | Conversion | Cost | Example |
|------|--------|------------|------|---------|
| **Seeds** | Word of mouth, referrals, organic | Highest (best quality) | Lowest (takes time) | Customer referral, NPS-driven |
| **Nets** | Marketing campaigns, inbound | Medium | Medium | Content marketing, SEO, webinars |
| **Spears** | Outbound prospecting | Lower (but predictable) | Higher (people-intensive) | Cold Calling 2.0, targeted outreach |

**Key insight:** Most companies over-invest in nets (marketing) and under-invest in spears (outbound). Seeds are the best but can't be manufactured quickly. A balanced mix of all three creates predictable revenue.

**Revenue mix:**
- **Seeds:** Invest in customer success, NPS, referral programs
- **Nets:** Invest in content, SEO, paid acquisition
- **Spears:** Invest in SDR team, Cold Calling 2.0

See: [references/lead-types.md](references/lead-types.md) for lead source strategy and investment allocation.

## Sales Role Specialization

**The #1 principle: Separate prospecting from closing.**

**Traditional (broken) model:**
- AEs prospect AND close
- Result: AEs hate prospecting, pipeline is feast-or-famine

**Predictable Revenue model:**

| Role | Focus | Metrics |
|------|-------|---------|
| **SDR (Sales Development Rep)** | Outbound prospecting → qualified opportunities | Qualified meetings/month |
| **MDR (Market Development Rep)** | Inbound lead qualification | Qualified leads/month |
| **AE (Account Executive)** | Close deals | Revenue closed, win rate |
| **CSM (Customer Success Manager)** | Retain and grow accounts | Retention rate, expansion revenue |

### SDR (Sales Development Rep)

**Mission:** Generate qualified pipeline through outbound prospecting.

**Focus:**
- Research target accounts
- Write personalized Cold Calling 2.0 emails
- Get referred to the right person
- Qualify opportunities (ANUM)
- Pass qualified opportunities to AEs

**Not their job:**
- Close deals
- Handle inbound leads
- Manage existing customers

**Metrics:**
- Qualified opportunities generated per month
- Response rate to outbound emails
- Meetings booked per week
- Pipeline value generated

**SDR capacity:** One SDR typically generates 10-20 qualified opportunities per month.

### AE (Account Executive)

**Mission:** Close deals from qualified pipeline.

**Focus:**
- Run discovery calls
- Demo and present solutions
- Negotiate and close
- Hand off to CSM

**Not their job:**
- Prospect for new leads (this is SDR's job)
- Qualify inbound leads (this is MDR's job)
- Manage post-sale relationships (CSM's job)

**Metrics:**
- Revenue closed
- Win rate
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length

### CSM (Customer Success Manager)

**Mission:** Retain customers and grow accounts.

**Focus:**
- Onboard new customers
- Drive adoption and engagement
- Identify expansion opportunities
- Prevent churn

**Metrics:**
- Net revenue retention
- Churn rate
- Expansion revenue
- NPS / CSAT

**The virtuous cycle:**
```
SDR generates pipeline → AE closes → CSM retains/grows → Happy customer refers (Seeds)
```

See: [references/roles.md](references/roles.md) for role definitions, career paths, and hiring profiles.

## Cold Calling 2.0

**The outbound prospecting methodology that replaces traditional cold calling.**

**Why traditional cold calling fails:**
- Gatekeepers block calls
- Decision makers don't answer phones
- 1-3% connection rate
- Damages brand
- Not scalable

**Cold Calling 2.0 process:**

```
1. Build list → 2. Send mass email → 3. Get referral → 4. Call the referral → 5. Qualify
```

### Step 1: Build Target Account List

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Industry
- Technology stack
- Geography
- Pain points

**Build list using:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- ZoomInfo / Apollo / Clearbit
- Company websites
- Industry directories

**Target:** 200-500 accounts per SDR per quarter

### Step 2: The Referral Email

**The core innovation:** Don't email the decision maker directly. Email above them and ask for a referral down.

**Why it works:**
- Senior people are helpful (they forward emails)
- Referrals have 3-5x higher response rate
- Creates warm introduction from within the company

**The email template:**

**Subject:** Quick question

**Body:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm not sure if you're the right person to speak to about [specific topic] at [Company], but I was hoping you could point me to the right person.
>
> We help [companies like theirs] with [specific value prop].
>
> Would you mind pointing me to the right person to talk to?
>
> Thanks,
> [Your name]

**Key elements:**
- Short (< 100 words)
- No pitch, no attachments, no links
- Asks for referral, not a meeting
- Specific about what you do
- Easy to forward

**Response rate:** 9-15% (vs. 1-3% for traditional cold emails)

### Step 3: Follow Up

**Follow-up sequence:**

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 1 | Send referral email |
| Day 3 | Follow up if no response |
| Day 7 | Second follow up (different angle) |
| Day 14 | Break-up email ("Should I close your file?") |
| Day 30 | Re-engage (new trigger event or content) |

**Break-up email example:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> I haven't heard back from you. I don't want to be a pest.
>
> Should I close your file, or would it make sense to chat?
>
> [Your name]

**Why break-up emails work:** People respond to the threat of losing access/opportunity (scarcity principle).

### Step 4: Qualify with ANUM

**ANUM qualification framework:**

| Criteria | Question | Strong Signal | Weak Signal |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **A**uthority | Can this person decide? | Decision maker or strong influencer | No buying power |
| **N**eed | Do they have the problem you solve? | Active pain, looking for solutions | "Nice to have" |
| **U**rgency | When do they need to solve it? | This quarter, budget allocated | "Someday" |
| **M**oney | Can they afford it? | Budget exists, within range | No budget, too expensive |

**Qualification call structure:**
1. Build rapport (2 min)
2. Set agenda ("I want to understand your situation and see if there's a fit")
3. Discovery questions (10-15 min)
4. ANUM qualification (built into discovery)
5. Next steps (if qualified → schedule AE demo)

### Step 5: Hand Off to AE

**The handoff must include:**
- Account background and ICP match
- Contact details and role
- Pain points discovered
- ANUM qualification notes
- Agreed next steps
- Any competitive intel

**Handoff meeting:** SDR introduces AE on a brief 3-way call or email, then drops off.

See: [references/cold-calling-2.md](references/cold-calling-2.md) for email templates, sequences, and scripts.

## Pipeline Math

**The math of predictable revenue:**

```
Revenue Goal ÷ Average Deal Size = Deals Needed
Deals Needed ÷ Win Rate = Opportunities Needed
Opportunities Needed ÷ SDR Conversion = Prospects Needed
Prospects Needed ÷ Response Rate = Emails Needed
```

**Example:**
- **Revenue goal:** $1M ARR
- **Average deal:** $20K ARR
- **Deals needed:** 50
- **Win rate:** 25%
- **Opportunities needed:** 200
- **SDR conversion:** 10% of responses become qualified
- **Response rate:** 10% of emails get responses
- **Emails needed:** 20,000
- **SDRs needed:** ~2-3 (each sends 300-500 emails/month)

**Capacity planning:**

| Metric | Benchmark | Your Number |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Emails per SDR per day | 50-100 | |
| Response rate | 9-15% | |
| Qualified opportunities per SDR per month | 10-20 | |
| AE demo-to-close rate | 20-30% | |
| Average sales cycle | 30-90 days | |

See: [references/pipeline-math.md](references/pipeline-math.md) for revenue modeling templates.

## Building the Sales Development Team

### Hiring SDRs

**Ideal SDR profile:**
- Coachable (most important trait)
- Curious and intelligent
- Strong writing skills
- Resilient (handles rejection)
- Organized and process-oriented
- Not necessarily experienced

**Where to hire:**
- Recent graduates
- Career changers
- Internal transfers
- SDR-to-AE career path candidates

**SDR career path:**
```
SDR (6-18 months) → Senior SDR → AE or SDR Manager
```

### SDR Ramp Time

| Phase | Timeline | Expectations |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Training** | Weeks 1-2 | Product knowledge, tools, process |
| **Shadowing** | Weeks 3-4 | Observe experienced SDRs, practice |
| **Ramping** | Months 2-3 | 50% of full quota |
| **Full quota** | Month 4+ | 100% of quota |

**Full ramp:** Expect 3-4 months to full productivity.

### SDR Compensation

**Structure:** Base salary + variable (commission on qualified opportunities)

**Typical split:** 60/40 or 70/30 (base/variable)

**Variable triggers:**
- Per qualified opportunity generated
- Bonus for opportunities that close
- Bonus for hitting/exceeding quota

See: [references/team-building.md](references/team-building.md) for hiring, onboarding, and compensation.

## Metrics and Dashboards

**Key metrics to track:**

### Leading Indicators (Predictive)
- Emails sent per SDR per day
- Response rate
- Meetings booked per week
- Qualified opportunities per month
- Pipeline value generated

### Lagging Indicators (Results)
- Revenue closed
- Win rate
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)

### Efficiency Metrics
- Cost per qualified opportunity
- SDR:AE ratio (typically 2-3 SDRs per AE)
- LTV:CAC ratio (target >3:1)
- Payback period

**Dashboard cadence:**
- **Daily:** Activity metrics (emails, calls, responses)
- **Weekly:** Pipeline metrics (opportunities, meetings)
- **Monthly:** Revenue metrics (closed, win rate, cycle)
- **Quarterly:** Efficiency metrics (CAC, LTV, ratios)

See: [references/metrics.md](references/metrics.md) for dashboard templates.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **AEs prospecting** | Feast-or-famine pipeline | Hire dedicated SDRs |
| **Long, pitchy emails** | Low response rate | Short, referral-focused emails |
| **No ICP definition** | Wasted effort on wrong accounts | Define ICP before hiring SDRs |
| **Too few SDRs** | Can't generate enough pipeline | Pipeline math: work backward from revenue goal |
| **No hand-off process** | Leads fall through cracks | Standardize SDR→AE handoff |
| **Measuring activity, not results** | Busy but not productive | Track qualified opportunities, not just emails |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any B2B sales process:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Are prospecting and closing separated? | SDRs doing both = bottleneck | Create dedicated SDR role |
| Is there a defined outbound process? | Ad-hoc prospecting | Implement Cold Calling 2.0 |
| Can you predict pipeline 3 months out? | Revenue is unpredictable | Build pipeline math model |
| Do you know your lead type mix? | Over-reliance on one source | Balance seeds, nets, spears |
| Is SDR→AE handoff standardized? | Leads lost in transition | Create handoff checklist |
