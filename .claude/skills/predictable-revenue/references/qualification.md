# ANUM Qualification Framework

Qualification is the art of determining whether a prospect is worth pursuing. In the Predictable Revenue model, SDRs use the ANUM framework to qualify prospects before passing them to AEs. ANUM stands for Authority, Need, Urgency, and Money. This guide provides a deep dive into each component, a complete discovery question bank, scoring criteria, disqualification techniques, and a comparison with other frameworks.

## Why Qualification Matters

Without qualification, two bad things happen:

1. **AEs waste time on unqualified deals.** Every hour spent on a deal that will never close is an hour not spent on a deal that could.
2. **Pipeline becomes unreliable.** Unqualified opportunities inflate pipeline numbers, making forecasts inaccurate and creating false confidence.

A well-qualified pipeline has higher win rates, shorter sales cycles, and more predictable revenue, which is the entire point.

## The ANUM Framework

| Criteria | Core Question | What You Are Really Asking |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **A** — Authority | Can this person make or influence the decision? | Will I be talking to someone who can actually say yes? |
| **N** — Need | Do they have the problem we solve? | Is there a real, painful problem driving this? |
| **U** — Urgency | When do they need to solve it? | Will they act now, or is this a "nice to have" for someday? |
| **M** — Money | Can they afford our solution? | Is there budget, and is our price within range? |

### Why ANUM Orders It This Way

Traditional frameworks (like BANT) start with Budget. ANUM starts with Authority because:

- If you are not talking to someone with authority, nothing else matters.
- Need comes second because budget and urgency can be created if the need is strong enough.
- Urgency determines whether this is a now deal or a nurture.
- Money comes last because budget often follows a strong enough need and urgency.

## Authority: Identifying Decision Makers

### Types of Stakeholders

| Role | Description | Influence | Example |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Decision maker** | Has final sign-off authority | Highest | VP of Sales, CRO, CEO |
| **Economic buyer** | Controls the budget | High | CFO, VP Finance, Department Head |
| **Champion** | Wants your solution and will advocate internally | High | Director, Senior Manager |
| **Influencer** | Provides input but cannot decide alone | Medium | Team Lead, IC with domain expertise |
| **Gatekeeper** | Controls access to decision makers | Low (but important) | Executive Assistant, Procurement |
| **Blocker** | May oppose the purchase | Negative | IT security, legal, incumbent vendor champion |

### Authority Discovery Questions

1. "Who else would be involved in evaluating a solution like this?"
2. "Walk me through how decisions like this typically get made at [Company]."
3. "If we were to move forward, what would the approval process look like?"
4. "Have you made a purchase like this before? How did that process work?"
5. "Is there anyone else who would need to see a demo or be part of this conversation?"
6. "What is your role in this decision?"

### Navigating Buying Committees

For deals involving multiple stakeholders (common in mid-market and enterprise):

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Map the committee | Identify all stakeholders and their roles |
| 2 | Identify the champion | Find the person who will sell internally for you |
| 3 | Arm the champion | Give them materials, ROI data, and talking points |
| 4 | Multi-thread | Build relationships with 2-3 stakeholders, not just one |
| 5 | Address the blocker | Proactively handle objections from opponents |
| 6 | Align on process | Get agreement on decision timeline and steps |

## Need: Uncovering Real Pain

### Surface Need vs. Deep Need

| Level | Example | Quality |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Surface | "We need better reporting." | Weak — could be nice-to-have |
| Functional | "We cannot track pipeline by SDR, so we do not know who is underperforming." | Moderate — specific but not emotional |
| Impact | "Because we cannot see SDR performance, we have lost two good reps who felt unrecognized, and our pipeline dropped 30% last quarter." | Strong — pain is real, consequences are clear |

Always dig to the impact level. Surface needs do not close deals.

### Need Discovery Questions

1. "What is the biggest challenge your team is facing right now related to [area]?"
2. "How are you handling [process] today?"
3. "What happens when [the problem] occurs? What is the impact?"
4. "How much time does your team spend on [manual process] each week?"
5. "What have you tried so far to solve this?"
6. "Why hasn't that worked?"
7. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [area], what would it be?"
8. "What does this problem cost you? In revenue? In time? In people?"
9. "How does this problem affect your team's goals for this quarter?"
10. "Is this a problem your leadership team is aware of and prioritizing?"

### Need Scoring

| Signal | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Active pain, actively looking for solutions | Strong | They are in buying mode |
| Problem acknowledged but not actively solving | Moderate | Needs urgency to become a deal |
| "Nice to have" improvement | Weak | Likely to stall |
| No problem identified | Disqualify | Not a fit right now |

## Urgency: Assessing Timeline

### Compelling Events

A compelling event is an external force that creates a deadline for action. Deals with compelling events close at 2-3x the rate of deals without them.

| Compelling Event | Why It Creates Urgency |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Contract renewal with existing vendor | Must decide before renewal date |
| New leadership (new VP, CRO, CEO) | New leader wants to make their mark |
| Funding round | Capital to invest, pressure to grow |
| Board mandate | Explicit directive to improve an area |
| Regulatory deadline | Must comply by a specific date |
| Competitive pressure | Competitor is pulling ahead |
| Hiring plan | Building a team that needs tools |
| Fiscal year budget cycle | "Use it or lose it" budget |

### Urgency Discovery Questions

1. "When do you need to have a solution in place?"
2. "Is there a specific event or deadline driving this?"
3. "What happens if you do not solve this in the next 90 days?"
4. "Is this in your plan for this quarter, or is it a future initiative?"
5. "Has your leadership set a timeline for addressing this?"
6. "When does your current contract expire?"
7. "If we could show you value, how quickly could you move forward?"

### Urgency Scoring

| Signal | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Compelling event within 90 days | Strong | High likelihood of closing this quarter |
| General priority for this quarter | Moderate | May close but could slip |
| "Next year" or "someday" | Weak | Nurture, do not pursue actively |
| No timeline, no compelling event | Very Weak | Likely waste of time |

## Money: Budget Qualification

### How to Talk About Budget Without Being Pushy

Budget conversations are uncomfortable for SDRs. The key is to frame budget as a mutual qualification step, not a sales tactic.

**Framing script:**
> "I want to make sure we're a fit from a budget perspective before we invest more of your time. Our solutions typically range from $X to $Y depending on scope. Does that range align with what you're expecting to invest?"

### Money Discovery Questions

1. "Have you allocated budget for solving this problem?"
2. "What range of investment are you considering for a solution like this?"
3. "How does your organization typically budget for new tools or services?"
4. "Have you purchased a similar solution before? What did you invest?"
5. "If the ROI is clear, is budget something that could be created?"
6. "Who owns the budget for this area?"
7. "Is this a capital expense or an operating expense for you?"

### Money Scoring

| Signal | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Budget allocated, within our range | Strong | No budget blocker |
| Budget exists but needs reallocation | Moderate | Possible but adds friction |
| No budget, but authority to create it | Moderate | Depends on need and urgency strength |
| No budget, no authority to create it | Weak | Likely stalls at procurement |
| Price objection (too expensive) | Evaluate | May indicate poor fit or need for ROI justification |

## Qualification Call Script Template

### Opening (2 minutes)

> "Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I appreciate it. Before we dive in, let me set the agenda: I want to learn about what you are working on, understand your challenges, and see if there is a good fit. If there is, I will connect you with a specialist on our team. If not, no hard feelings. Sound good?"

### Discovery and ANUM (12-15 minutes)

**Need (start here to build rapport):**

> "Tell me about how your team currently handles [area]. What is working well, and where are the biggest pain points?"

Follow up: "What is the impact of that? What happens when it goes wrong?"

**Authority:**

> "If you were to bring in a new solution, walk me through how that decision would work at [Company]. Who else would be involved?"

**Urgency:**

> "Is there a timeline for solving this? Anything driving the need to act soon?"

**Money:**

> "I want to respect your time, so let me ask: our solutions typically fall in the range of $X to $Y. Does that align with what you are expecting to invest?"

### Wrap-Up (3 minutes)

If qualified:
> "Based on what you have shared, I think there is a strong fit. I would like to connect you with [AE Name], who specializes in helping companies like yours with [specific area]. Would [day/time] work for a 30-minute conversation?"

If not qualified:
> "I appreciate you sharing this. Based on what I am hearing, it sounds like the timing may not be right / we may not be the best fit right now. Would it be okay if I checked back in [timeframe]?"

| 4-6 | C-grade opportunity | Nurture, revisit in 30-60 days |
| 0-3 | Not qualified | Disqualify, add to long-term nurture or remove |

## When to Disqualify (and How to Do It Gracefully)

### Disqualification Criteria

Disqualify when:

- [ ] No identifiable need (they do not have the problem you solve)
- [ ] No authority and no path to authority (nobody will champion this)
- [ ] No urgency and no compelling event (this will never become a priority)
- [ ] Budget is fundamentally mismatched (they cannot afford it, period)
- [ ] ICP mismatch (wrong company size, industry, or use case)
- [ ] Competitive lock-in (long-term contract with a competitor, not ending soon)

### Graceful Disqualification Scripts

**No need:**
> "Based on our conversation, it sounds like [area] is in a good place for you right now. That is great. If things change in the future, I would love to reconnect. Mind if I check in in 6 months?"

**Bad timing:**
> "It sounds like the timing is not quite right. I totally understand. I will set a reminder to reach out in [quarter] when this becomes more relevant. Is that okay?"

**Budget mismatch:**
> "I want to be transparent: our solution typically starts at $X, and it sounds like that may be above where you are right now. Rather than waste your time, would it make sense to revisit this when budget opens up?"

## ANUM vs. BANT vs. MEDDIC

| Aspect | ANUM | BANT | MEDDIC |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Origin** | Predictable Revenue | IBM (1960s) | PTC (1990s) |
| **Best for** | SDR qualification (initial) | Simple, transactional sales | Complex enterprise sales |
| **Lead with** | Authority | Budget | Metrics |
| **Budget focus** | Last (need drives budget) | First (budget gates everything) | Implicit (Economic Buyer) |
| **Complexity** | Low (4 criteria) | Low (4 criteria) | High (6 criteria) |
| **Deal stage** | Early (prospecting) | Early-Mid | Mid-Late (AE-led) |

**BANT** (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline): Simple and widely understood, but leading with budget disqualifies too early and misses champion dynamics. Best for transactional sales with short cycles.

**MEDDIC** (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion): Comprehensive for complex enterprise deals, but too heavy for SDR-level qualification. Best for AE-managed opportunities with long cycles and buying committees.

**Best practice:** Use ANUM for SDR qualification, then transition to MEDDIC once the AE takes over the opportunity.
