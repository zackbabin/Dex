# The Three Lead Types: Seeds, Nets, and Spears

Not all leads are created equal. Aaron Ross identifies three fundamentally different lead types, each with distinct economics, timelines, and management strategies. Companies that treat all leads the same waste resources and create unpredictable revenue. This guide provides a deep dive into cultivating each type and building the right mix for your stage.

## Seeds: Organic and Referral-Driven Growth

Seeds are the highest-converting, lowest-cost leads, but they take the longest to cultivate. They come from word-of-mouth, customer referrals, organic search, and community reputation.

### Why Seeds Convert Best

- Built-in trust from the referral source
- The prospect already understands your value proposition
- Shorter sales cycles (30-50% faster than spears)
- Higher average deal sizes (warm introductions reduce price sensitivity)
- Lower churn (referred customers stay 18-37% longer on average)

### Seed Cultivation Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Timeline to Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Customer referral program** | Structured ask with incentives at key moments | 3-6 months |
| **NPS follow-up** | Ask promoters (9-10 scores) for introductions | 1-3 months |
| **Customer advisory board** | Engaged customers become advocates | 6-12 months |
| **Community building** | Slack groups, events, user groups | 6-18 months |
| **Content from customers** | Case studies, webinars, co-marketing | 3-6 months |
| **Partner referrals** | Complementary vendors refer to you | 3-9 months |

### When to Ask for Referrals

The best moments to request a referral:

1. **After a successful onboarding milestone** (customer achieved first value)
2. **After a positive support interaction** (you solved their problem fast)
3. **After a QBR with strong metrics** (ROI is clear and documented)
4. **After an NPS score of 9 or 10** (they just told you they would recommend you)
5. **After a renewal or expansion** (they voted with their wallet)

### Real-World Seed Example: Dropbox

Dropbox built its early growth almost entirely on Seeds. Their referral program offered free storage to both the referrer and the invitee. This two-sided incentive drove a 60% increase in signups. By 2010, 35% of daily signups came from referrals. Dropbox scaled from 100K to 4M users in 15 months primarily through seed-driven viral loops.

### Common Seed Mistakes

- Asking for referrals too early (before the customer has seen value)
- No structured referral program (relying on organic only)
- Not tracking referral sources to understand which customers refer best
- Ignoring Seeds because they "just happen" — they need cultivation

## Nets: Inbound Marketing Campaigns

Nets are marketing-generated leads that come from casting a wide net — content marketing, paid ads, SEO, webinars, events. They produce medium-quality leads at medium cost.

### Net Channel Strategies

| Channel | Best For | Lead Quality | Cost | Time to Impact |
|---------|----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **SEO / Content marketing** | Long-term pipeline | Medium-High | Low (time-intensive) | 6-12 months |
| **Paid search (Google Ads)** | High-intent capture | High | High | Immediate |
| **Paid social (LinkedIn)** | Targeted B2B audiences | Medium | Medium-High | 1-3 months |
| **Webinars** | Education-stage leads | Medium | Medium | 1-2 months |
| **Trade shows / Events** | Relationship building | Variable | Very High | 1-6 months |
| **Email marketing** | Nurturing existing contacts | Medium | Low | 1-3 months |
| **Partner co-marketing** | Shared audiences | Medium-High | Medium | 2-4 months |

### Real-World Net Example: HubSpot

HubSpot pioneered inbound marketing as its own Net strategy. By publishing thousands of blog posts, free tools (Website Grader), and certification courses, HubSpot generated millions of monthly visitors and tens of thousands of inbound leads. Their content-first approach kept CAC low while building brand authority, and the free CRM tier served as a massive Net that captured leads who self-qualified by using the product.

### Inbound Lead Qualification

Not all inbound leads are ready for sales. The MDR (Market Development Rep) role exists to separate signal from noise.

**MDR qualification checklist:**

- [ ] Does the lead match your ICP (company size, industry, geography)?
- [ ] Did they take a high-intent action (demo request, pricing page, trial)?
- [ ] Is there a real person with a business email?
- [ ] Can you identify a plausible use case?
- [ ] Is the timing right (or is this a long-term nurture)?

### Net Metrics to Track

- Cost per lead (CPL) by channel
- Lead-to-MQL conversion rate
- MQL-to-SQL conversion rate
- SQL-to-closed-won rate
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) by channel
- Time from first touch to closed deal

## Spears: Outbound Prospecting

Spears are targeted outbound efforts — specific accounts and contacts pursued through Cold Calling 2.0. They are the most predictable lead type because you control the volume.

### Why Spears Create Predictability

1. **You choose the targets** — no waiting for leads to find you
2. **Volume is controllable** — hire more SDRs, send more emails
3. **Pipeline math works** — conversion rates stabilize over time
4. **You reach companies that don't know they need you yet**
5. **Faster market feedback** — you learn what resonates quickly

### Systematic Spear Approach

| Phase | Activity | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. Define ICP** | Identify ideal company and buyer persona | Target account list |
| **2. Build lists** | Research accounts, find contacts | 200-500 accounts per SDR per quarter |
| **3. Craft messaging** | Write referral email templates | 3-5 email variations |
| **4. Execute sequences** | Send Cold Calling 2.0 emails | 50-100 emails per SDR per day |
| **5. Handle responses** | Qualify, book meetings | 10-20 qualified opps per SDR per month |
| **6. Optimize** | A/B test, refine ICP, improve messaging | Continuously improving conversion |

### Real-World Spear Example: Salesforce (Early Days)

Salesforce built its initial customer base through disciplined outbound. Aaron Ross himself joined Salesforce and created the Cold Calling 2.0 methodology there. A team of SDRs sent targeted referral-style emails to VP-level contacts at mid-market companies, generating $100M in incremental pipeline. This outbound engine became the model for the entire SaaS industry's SDR-driven growth playbook.

### Common Spear Mistakes

- Spraying generic emails to untargeted lists
- Targeting too broadly (no clear ICP)
- Not following up enough (most deals require 5+ touches)
- Measuring emails sent instead of qualified opportunities created
- Having AEs do their own prospecting instead of dedicated SDRs

## Investment Allocation Framework

The right mix of Seeds, Nets, and Spears depends on your company stage, deal size, and growth targets.

### Recommended Allocation by Company Stage

| Stage | Revenue | Seeds | Nets | Spears | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Pre-product-market fit** | <$1M ARR | 60% | 30% | 10% | Lean on founder relationships and early adopters |
| **Early growth** | $1M-$5M ARR | 40% | 30% | 30% | Begin building outbound alongside inbound |
| **Growth** | $5M-$20M ARR | 25% | 35% | 40% | Scale outbound aggressively; inbound matures |
| **Scale** | $20M-$100M ARR | 20% | 35% | 45% | Outbound is primary growth engine |
| **Enterprise** | $100M+ ARR | 20% | 30% | 50% | Account-based, high-value spear strategies |

### Allocation by Deal Size

| Average Deal Size | Seeds | Nets | Spears |
|-------------------|-------|------|--------|
| **< $5K ACV** | 20% | 60% | 20% |
| **$5K - $25K ACV** | 25% | 35% | 40% |
| **$25K - $100K ACV** | 25% | 25% | 50% |
| **> $100K ACV** | 30% | 15% | 55% |

Larger deals justify the higher cost-per-lead of outbound because the payoff per conversion is much larger.

## Measuring Lead Type Effectiveness

| Average sales cycle | 20-45 days | 30-60 days | 45-90 days |
| Typical LTV:CAC | 8-15:1 | 3-6:1 | 2-5:1 |

## Common Mistake: Over-Reliance on One Type

### Signs You Are Over-Reliant on Seeds

- Revenue is unpredictable and lumpy
- Growth stalls when referrals slow down
- No systematic process to generate new business
- You cannot forecast next quarter's pipeline

### Signs You Are Over-Reliant on Nets

- High marketing spend with declining ROI
- Long sales cycles because leads are not sales-ready
- Marketing and sales blame each other for poor conversion
- You attract lots of tire-kickers

### Signs You Are Over-Reliant on Spears

- Very high CAC
- SDR team burns out from constant rejection
- Pipeline collapses if SDRs leave or underperform
- No organic growth or brand pull

**The fix is always balance.** Audit your current mix, compare to the benchmarks above, and shift investment toward the underweighted type.

### Quarterly Review Questions

1. Did our actual lead mix match our target?
2. Which type outperformed or underperformed expectations?
3. How did conversion rates change for each type?
4. What is our cost per opportunity by lead type?
5. Should we shift allocation for next quarter?
