# ERRC Grid: The Four Actions Framework

The Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) grid is the operational tool that translates blue ocean thinking into concrete strategic actions. It forces companies to pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously by asking four questions that challenge industry logic. This reference provides a complete guide to facilitating, applying, and validating ERRC decisions.

## The Four Actions

### Eliminate

**Core question:** Which factors that the industry has long competed on should be eliminated entirely?

These are factors the industry takes for granted but that add cost without proportional value to buyers. Elimination is the most powerful action because it simultaneously reduces cost and simplifies the offering.

**How to identify elimination candidates:**
- Factors that exist because "we have always done it this way"
- Features that only a small minority of buyers use
- Factors that exist because competitors have them, not because buyers need them
- Compliance with industry norms that buyers do not care about
- Legacy features that served past needs but are now irrelevant

**Warning signs that a factor should be eliminated:**
- Removing it in a test does not generate complaints
- Buyers do not mention it when describing why they buy
- It requires significant cost but does not appear in purchase criteria
- Non-customers cite it as a reason they avoid the industry

### Reduce

**Core question:** Which factors should be reduced well below the industry standard?

These are factors where the industry over-delivers relative to what buyers actually need. Reduction captures the insight that "good enough" on certain dimensions frees resources for factors that matter more.

**How to identify reduction candidates:**
- Factors where diminishing returns have set in
- Areas where the industry standard exceeds what most buyers need
- Features that increase complexity without proportional utility
- Factors that drive cost but where buyers would accept a lower level

**The reduction test:** If you reduced this factor by 50%, would most buyers notice? Would they care enough to switch to a competitor?

### Raise

**Core question:** Which factors should be raised well above the industry standard?

These are factors where the industry currently under-delivers relative to buyer expectations or latent needs. Raising them creates differentiation that buyers immediately value.

**How to identify raise candidates:**
- Factors where customer complaints are persistent
- Dimensions where alternatives from other industries outperform your industry
- Areas where buyers have developed workarounds because the industry standard is not good enough
- Factors that correlate most strongly with buyer satisfaction and loyalty

### Create

**Core question:** Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

These are entirely new sources of value that redefine what the offering means. Creation is what opens new demand and attracts non-customers.

**How to identify creation opportunities:**
- Pain points in the buyer experience cycle that no one addresses
- Needs currently served by complementary products or services
- Desires expressed by non-customers that the industry does not serve
- Capabilities enabled by new technology that the industry has not applied
- Emotional or social needs in a functionally-oriented industry (or vice versa)

## Detailed Questions for Each Action

### Eliminate Deep-Dive Questions

1. What do we offer because competitors offer it, not because buyers need it?
2. What would happen if we stopped doing this tomorrow?
3. Which features have usage rates below 10%?
4. What costs us the most but appears nowhere in buyer decision criteria?
5. Which factors exist to serve a small segment that we could choose not to serve?
6. What industry traditions or norms would a new entrant from outside the industry find absurd?
7. What do non-customers find unappealing or unnecessary about our industry?

### Reduce Deep-Dive Questions

1. Where do we exceed what 80% of buyers need?
2. Which specifications could we cut in half without meaningful impact?
3. Where has the industry engaged in an escalation war that buyers did not ask for?
4. What premium features do most customers pay for but rarely use?
5. Which support or service levels could be simplified?
6. Where is "good enough" genuinely good enough for the target mass market?

### Raise Deep-Dive Questions

1. Where do buyers consistently express frustration with the industry standard?
2. Which factors do alternatives from other industries handle better?
3. Where have buyers created workarounds because the current standard is inadequate?
4. What would it take to move customer satisfaction from 3/5 to 5/5 on key factors?
5. Which factor, if raised dramatically, would attract non-customers?
6. Where is the gap between what buyers expect and what the industry delivers widest?

### Create Deep-Dive Questions

1. What job is the buyer trying to accomplish before, during, and after using our product?
2. What complementary products or services do buyers currently need alongside ours?
3. What would make non-customers consider our industry for the first time?
4. What emotional or social needs are unmet by the industry's functional focus (or vice versa)?
5. What would buyers design if they could start from scratch?
6. What trends will reshape buyer expectations in the next 3-5 years?
7. What pain points exist in the buyer experience cycle that no one addresses?

## Industry Examples of ERRC Applied

### Technology: Zoom (Video Conferencing)

| Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Hardware requirements (dedicated systems) | Feature complexity for basic use | Audio/video reliability | One-click join (no account needed for guests) |
| Enterprise-only sales model | Per-minute pricing | Meeting capacity (free tier: 100 people) | Gallery view (see everyone at once) |
| Complex setup/IT deployment | Configuration options | Cross-platform compatibility | Virtual backgrounds |
| | | | Breakout rooms at scale |

**Result:** Zoom did not invent video conferencing. It made it work reliably and removed every friction point, unlocking demand from education, social users, and small businesses who had never used video conferencing before.

### Retail: IKEA (Furniture)

| Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Sales assistance on the floor | Material quality (functional, not luxury) | Design quality (Scandinavian aesthetic) | Self-service warehouse shopping |
| Home delivery (customer transports) | Furniture longevity (designed for life stages) | Range of home products | Flat-pack self-assembly |
| Assembled furniture | | In-store experience | Restaurant inside the store |
| | | Affordability | Room display showrooms |
| | | | Online planning tools |

**Result:** IKEA serves customers who would otherwise buy cheap, poorly designed furniture or delay purchasing entirely. The self-assembly trade-off (a reduction in convenience) funds the raising of design quality and the creation of an inspiring shopping experience.

### Healthcare: MinuteClinic (Walk-In Clinics)

| Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Appointments | Range of services (only common conditions) | Convenience (walk-in, no wait scheduling) | Retail location (inside CVS/pharmacy) |
| Doctor requirement (nurse practitioners) | Wait time for simple issues | Transparent pricing | Electronic health records integration |
| Full diagnostic workup | | Extended hours (evenings, weekends) | Immediate prescription fulfillment (same pharmacy) |
| Insurance complexity for simple visits | | | Online check-in and wait time visibility |

**Result:** MinuteClinic did not compete with hospitals or primary care physicians. It served people who would otherwise skip treatment for minor issues because the traditional healthcare system was too slow, expensive, or inconvenient.

### Education: Khan Academy (Online Learning)

| Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Tuition fees | In-person instruction | Accessibility (free, global) | Mastery-based progression |
| Fixed schedule | Textbook dependence | Practice exercises per concept | Personalized learning dashboard |
| Geographic limitation | | Pace flexibility (pause, rewind, repeat) | Teacher/parent monitoring tools |
| Age/grade restrictions | | Content breadth | Gamification (badges, streaks) |
| Enrollment barriers | | | Adaptive difficulty |

**Result:** Khan Academy attracted millions of learners who could not access or afford traditional tutoring, as well as students whose in-school learning was insufficient. The elimination of tuition, schedule, and geographic barriers unlocked massive latent demand.

## Step-by-Step ERRC Workshop Facilitation Guide

### Preparation (1 week before)

1. Complete the strategy canvas exercise first (the ERRC grid builds on canvas insights)
2. Gather customer data: satisfaction surveys, NPS comments, support tickets, churn reasons
3. Gather non-customer data: interviews or surveys about why people avoid the industry
4. Prepare printed ERRC grid templates (one per participant plus extras)
5. Invite 8-12 cross-functional participants

### Workshop Agenda (3.5 hours)

**Part 1: Context Setting (30 minutes)**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00 | Review the strategy canvas from previous workshop |
| 0:10 | Share customer and non-customer data highlights |
| 0:20 | Introduce the ERRC framework and rules |

**Rules to establish:**
- No factor is sacred (everything is a candidate for elimination)
- Every "raise" or "create" must be funded by an "eliminate" or "reduce"
- Think from the buyer's perspective, not internal perspective
- Non-customers matter more than existing customers for this exercise

**Part 2: Individual ERRC Brainstorming (30 minutes)**

Each participant fills out their own ERRC grid silently. This prevents groupthink and ensures diverse perspectives.

**Part 3: Share and Cluster (45 minutes)**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1:00 | Each person shares their top 2 items per quadrant |
| 1:15 | Facilitator clusters similar ideas on whiteboard |
| 1:30 | Group discusses and debates each cluster |
| 1:45 | Vote on top 3 items per quadrant |

**Part 4: Break (15 minutes)**

**Part 5: Deepen and Validate (45 minutes)**

For each selected ERRC action, the group works through:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What is the specific cost impact? | Quantify elimination/reduction savings |
| What is the specific value impact? | Quantify raise/create value to buyers |
| What evidence supports this? | Ground decisions in data, not assumptions |
| What is the risk if we are wrong? | Identify reversible vs. irreversible decisions |
| How would competitors respond? | Assess defensibility |

**Part 6: Draw the New Value Curve (30 minutes)**

Using the finalized ERRC grid, draw the proposed value curve on the strategy canvas. Compare it to the current industry curves.

**Validation checks:**
- Is the curve divergent from competitors?
- Is it focused (not trying to be high on everything)?
- Can you articulate it in one sentence (compelling tagline)?

**Part 7: Action Planning (15 minutes)**

For each ERRC decision, assign:
- Owner
- Timeline
- Dependencies
- Success metric

## Validating ERRC Decisions

Before committing to ERRC actions, validate each decision against these criteria.

### Elimination Validation

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| Fewer than 20% of target buyers actively use this factor | |
| Removing it does not create legal/safety/compliance risk | |
| The cost savings are quantifiable and significant | |
| Non-customers would not be deterred by its absence | |
| A small test (removing the factor for a subset) confirms low impact | |

### Reduction Validation

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| The reduced level still meets the needs of 80%+ of target buyers | |
| The cost savings from reduction are meaningful | |
| Competitors' over-investment in this factor is not what buyers love about them | |
| The reduction does not harm the factors you are raising | |

### Raise Validation

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| Buyers cite this factor as a pain point or unmet need | |
| The investment is funded by elimination/reduction savings | |
| Raising this factor would attract non-customers | |
| You can sustainably deliver at this raised level | |

### Create Validation

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| No competitor currently offers this | |
| Non-customers have expressed this need (directly or indirectly) | |
| The creation is feasible at the target cost structure | |
| It integrates with the raised factors to form a coherent offering | |
| First-time buyers would understand its value quickly | |

## Common ERRC Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Eliminating What Customers Secretly Value

Some factors appear unimportant in surveys but drive emotional attachment. Test elimination with a small cohort before full commitment.

**Example:** A restaurant eliminates table cloths to reduce costs. Surveys never mentioned table cloths, but customers report the restaurant "feels cheaper" after the change.

**Fix:** Run small experiments. Observe behavior, not just survey responses.

### Mistake 2: Creating Without Demand Validation

Teams get excited about novel features that sound innovative but address no real buyer need. Every "create" should map to a documented pain point or non-customer barrier.

**Example:** A software company creates an AI feature because competitors are adding AI, not because users have a problem the AI solves.

**Fix:** Every create must answer: "Which specific non-customer barrier or buyer pain point does this address?"

### Mistake 3: Raising Everything, Eliminating Nothing

This is the most common mistake. Teams are willing to add but reluctant to subtract. The result is a "more for more" strategy that is not value innovation.

**Fix:** Enforce a strict rule: the number of eliminate + reduce items must equal or exceed the number of raise + create items.

### Mistake 4: Treating ERRC as a One-Time Exercise

Markets evolve. What you eliminate today may become important tomorrow. What you create today may become table stakes.

**Fix:** Revisit the ERRC grid quarterly. Update the strategy canvas annually.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Internal Resistance

Eliminating factors that employees have built their careers around creates organizational resistance. The ERRC grid is a strategic tool, but implementation requires change management.

**Fix:** Involve affected teams in the ERRC workshop. Use fair process (engagement, explanation, expectation clarity) to build buy-in.

### Mistake 6: Confusing Reduce with Eliminate

Reduction means still offering the factor, but at a lower level. Elimination means removing it entirely. The strategic and cost implications are different. Be deliberate about which action you are taking.

**Fix:** For each factor under consideration, explicitly ask: "Should we offer this at a lower level, or remove it completely?" The answer depends on whether any portion of the target market needs it.
