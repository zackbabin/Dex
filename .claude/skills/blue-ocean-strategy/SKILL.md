# Blue Ocean Strategy Framework

Strategic framework for creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant, based on simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost.

## Core Principle

**Don't compete in bloody red oceans. Create blue oceans of uncontested market space.**

Most companies fight for market share in existing industries (red oceans). Winners create new market space where competition is irrelevant (blue oceans) by delivering a leap in value for both buyers and themselves.

**The foundation:** Competition-based strategy is zero-sum. Value innovation creates new demand and breaks the value-cost trade-off.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When evaluating business strategy or value proposition, rate 0-10 based on blue ocean principles. A 10/10 means clear value innovation, elimination of unnecessary factors, and creation of new demand; lower scores indicate competing in red oceans. Always provide current score and improvements to reach 10/10.

## Red Ocean vs. Blue Ocean

| Red Ocean Strategy | Blue Ocean Strategy |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Compete in existing market space | Create uncontested market space |
| Beat the competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Exploit existing demand | Create and capture new demand |
| Make value-cost trade-off | Break value-cost trade-off |
| Align whole system with strategic choice of differentiation OR low cost | Align whole system in pursuit of differentiation AND low cost |

**Examples:**

**Red Ocean:**
- Airlines competing on routes, amenities, price
- Smartphone makers adding features competitors have
- Restaurants in same category fighting for customers

**Blue Ocean:**
- Cirque du Soleil: Not circus vs. circus, but new form of entertainment
- Netflix: Not video rental, but streaming entertainment
- Nintendo Wii: Not graphics power, but accessible motion gaming

See: [references/blue-ocean-examples.md](references/blue-ocean-examples.md) for detailed case studies.

## Value Innovation

**Value innovation = the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy.**

**Definition:** Simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost, creating a leap in value for both buyers and company.

```
Value Innovation = Utility × Price × Cost
```

**The value innovation logic:**

| Traditional View | Value Innovation View |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| High value = High cost | High value CAN = Low cost |
| Differentiate OR cut costs | Differentiate AND cut costs |
| Better performance on established factors | New factors, eliminate old factors |

**How it works:**
- **Eliminate** factors the industry takes for granted → Reduces costs
- **Reduce** factors below industry standard → Reduces costs
- **Raise** factors above industry standard → Increases value
- **Create** factors industry has never offered → Increases value

**Result:** Lower cost structure AND superior value proposition.

**Example: Cirque du Soleil**
- **Eliminated:** Animal shows, star performers, multiple show arenas (reduced costs)
- **Reduced:** Fun and humor, thrill and danger (less important for target audience)
- **Raised:** Unique venue, artistic music and dance (differentiation)
- **Created:** Theme, refined watching environment, multiple productions (new value)
- **Outcome:** Higher prices than circus, lower costs than theater, new market created

See: [references/value-innovation.md](references/value-innovation.md) for value innovation frameworks.

## Strategy Canvas

**The diagnostic tool for understanding current strategic position and discovering blue oceans.**

**How to create a Strategy Canvas:**

### Step 1: Identify Competing Factors

List all the factors the industry competes on.

**Example: Wine industry**
- Price
- Prestige/awards
- Aging quality
- Vineyard legacy
- Marketing
- Complexity (tasting language)
- Range (selection)
- Above-the-line marketing

### Step 2: Map Current State

Plot how you and competitors score on each factor (low to high).

**Typical result:** Everyone's curves look similar (red ocean).

### Step 3: Analyze

**Questions:**
- Which factors does the industry compete on but buyers don't care about?
- Which factors could be eliminated or reduced?
- Which factors could be raised or created?
- Where are there points of pain in the buyer experience?

**Example: Yellow Tail Wine**

| Factor | Industry Average | Yellow Tail |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Price | Medium-High | LOW |
| Prestige | High | LOW |
| Aging quality | High | LOW |
| Vineyard legacy | High | LOW |
| Complexity | High | LOW |
| Range | High | LOW |
| Easy drinking | Low | HIGH |
| Fun/adventure | Low | HIGH |
| Accessibility | Low | HIGH |

**Result:** Different curve = blue ocean.

See: [references/strategy-canvas.md](references/strategy-canvas.md) for templates and examples.

## Four Actions Framework (ERRC Grid)

**The tool for creating value innovation.**

**The framework:**

```
ELIMINATE                      RAISE
- Which factors the           - Which factors should be
  industry takes for            raised well above the
  granted should be             industry standard?
  eliminated?

REDUCE                         CREATE
- Which factors should        - Which factors should be
  be reduced well below         created that the
  the industry standard?        industry has never
                                offered?
```

**How to use:**

### 1. ELIMINATE

**Question:** What can we eliminate that the industry competes on but adds no value for customers?

**Examples:**
- **Cirque du Soleil:** Animals, star performers
- **Southwest Airlines:** Meals, seat assignments, hub transfers
- **IKEA:** Sales staff, assembly service, delivery

**Benefits:**
- Reduces cost structure
- Simplifies operations
- Often removes friction customers don't want anyway

**Warning:** Don't eliminate factors buyers truly value. Test assumptions.

### 2. REDUCE

**Question:** What can we offer well below industry standard?

**Examples:**
- **Yellow Tail:** Aging quality, prestige, complexity
- **Jet Blue:** Route flexibility (focused on key routes)
- **Salesforce:** Customization (v1.0 was simple)

**Benefits:**
- Lowers costs
- Removes over-served aspects
- Focuses resources on high-value factors

### 3. RAISE

**Question:** What should we raise well above industry standard?

**Examples:**
- **Cirque du Soleil:** Artistic value, unique venues
- **Dyson:** Suction power, design
- **Apple:** User experience, design aesthetics

**Benefits:**
- Creates differentiation
- Justifies premium pricing (if aligned with customer value)
- Hard for competitors to match

### 4. CREATE

**Question:** What new factors should we create that the industry has never offered?

**Examples:**
- **Cirque du Soleil:** Theatrical themes, refined environment
- **Netflix:** Unlimited streaming, no late fees, recommendation algorithm
- **Uber:** Real-time tracking, cashless payment, driver ratings

**Benefits:**
- Opens new value sources
- Attracts non-customers
- Creates competitive moat

**Putting it together:**

| Action | Effect on Cost | Effect on Value |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Eliminate | ⬇ Reduces | — (no loss if done right) |
| Reduce | ⬇ Reduces | — (over-served area) |
| Raise | ⬆ May increase | ⬆ Increases significantly |
| Create | ⬆ May increase | ⬆ Increases significantly |

**Net result:** Value increases more than cost (value innovation).

See: [references/errc-grid.md](references/errc-grid.md) for ERRC templates and exercises.

## The Six Paths Framework

**Six ways to identify blue ocean opportunities by looking beyond existing boundaries.**

### Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries

**Principle:** Customers choose between alternatives in different forms.

**Question:** What are the alternative industries to yours?

**Example:**
- Movie theaters compete with restaurants, bars, concerts (entertainment alternatives)
- NetJets (fractional jet ownership): Alternative to commercial airlines AND owning private jets

**How to apply:** Map alternatives → identify unmet needs across them → create solution

### Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups

**Principle:** Industries have clusters of companies pursuing similar strategies.

**Question:** What are the strategic groups, and can you create a new one?

**Example:**
- Car industry: luxury vs. economy
- Lexus: Created "luxury at accessible price" group

**How to apply:** Map strategic groups → identify over/under-served needs → position between groups

### Path 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers

**Principle:** Who influences the purchase may not be the end user.

**Question:** Can we target a different buyer in the chain?

**Chain:** Purchasers → Users → Influencers

**Example:**
- Novo Nordisk insulin pens: Targeted doctors (influencers) not patients (users)
- Bloomberg terminals: Targeted traders (users) not IT departments (purchasers)

**How to apply:** Identify all buyers in chain → explore unmet needs of overlooked groups

### Path 4: Look Across Complementary Products/Services

**Principle:** Value is often affected by complementary products.

**Question:** What happens before, during, and after using your product?

**Example:**
- Babysitting is complementary to movie theaters → AMC: "Date night" package
- Installation/training complements software → Salesforce: Built-in onboarding

**How to apply:** Map customer's total experience → identify pain points → bundle solutions

### Path 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal

**Principle:** Industries compete on either functional or emotional appeal, rarely both.

**Question:** Can we add emotional appeal to functional industries (or vice versa)?

**Examples:**
- **Add emotion to functional:** Swatch (watches as fashion, not just time-telling)
- **Add function to emotional:** The Body Shop (cosmetics with ethical sourcing story)

**How to apply:** Identify current appeal → explore opposite dimension → create hybrid

### Path 6: Look Across Time

**Principle:** Trends shape industries over time.

**Question:** What trends are shaping your industry, and how can you act on them now?

**Example:**
- Apple iPod/iTunes: Anticipated digital music trend before others
- Tesla: Bet on electric vehicles before mainstream adoption

**How to apply:** Identify irreversible trends → project future state → build for it today

See: [references/six-paths.md](references/six-paths.md) for detailed path exercises.

## Three Tiers of Non-Customers

**Blue oceans are created by converting non-customers, not stealing competitors' customers.**

### Tier 1: "Soon-to-be" Non-Customers
- On the edge of your market
- Minimally using offerings
- Ready to jump ship

**Opportunity:** Small shifts could win them over

**Example:** Pret A Manger won busy professionals who were "soon-to-be" non-customers of fast food (wanted healthy, fast)

### Tier 2: "Refusing" Non-Customers
- Considered your industry but consciously rejected it
- See offerings as unacceptable or beyond their means

**Opportunity:** Understand why they refuse, eliminate barriers

**Example:** JCDecaux bus-shelter advertising—cities refused outdoor ads until JCDecaux offered free bus shelters in exchange

### Tier 3: "Unexplored" Non-Customers
- In markets distant from yours
- Never considered your offerings as an option

**Opportunity:** Reframe offering to serve distant needs

**Example:** Callaway Big Bertha golf clubs—expanded market to beginners and occasional golfers (unexplored)

**Process:**
1. Map all three tiers
2. Find commonalities across tiers
3. Identify what would unlock massive demand
4. Build offering to convert non-customers

See: [references/non-customers.md](references/non-customers.md) for non-customer analysis frameworks.

## Sequence of Blue Ocean Strategy

**The right strategic sequence:**

```
1. Buyer Utility → 2. Strategic Price → 3. Target Cost → 4. Adoption
```

### 1. Buyer Utility

**Question:** Is there exceptional utility?

**Test:** Does your offering unlock a leap in buyer utility for each of the six utilities?

**Six utility levers:**
- Customer productivity
- Simplicity
- Convenience
- Risk reduction
- Fun and image
- Environmental friendliness

**Buyer Experience Cycle:** Purchase → Delivery → Use → Supplements → Maintenance → Disposal

**Goal:** Identify where the biggest blocks to utility are, and solve them.

### 2. Strategic Price

**Question:** Is pricing accessible to mass of buyers?

**Approach:** Price against alternatives (not costs or competitors in same industry)

**Steps:**
1. Identify alternatives (different forms, not just direct competitors)
2. Map price/performance of alternatives
3. Price within reach of mass buyers

**Example:** Cirque du Soleil priced higher than circus, lower than theater

### 3. Target Cost

**Question:** Can we achieve target cost while preserving utility?

**Formula:** `Strategic Price - Target Profit Margin = Target Cost`

**Approach:**
- Work backward from price
- Use ERRC to eliminate/reduce costs
- Partner to achieve cost target
- Refuse to sacrifice utility

**Anti-pattern:** "We'll achieve cost target later" (usually doesn't happen)

### 4. Adoption

**Question:** What are the adoption hurdles?

**Common hurdles:**
- Employees resist change
- Partners resist change
- General public resists
- Regulatory/legal barriers

**Solutions:**
- Educate stakeholders on benefits
- Build pilot programs
- Engage partners early
- Proactively address concerns

**Goal:** Clear path to scalable adoption.

See: [references/sequence.md](references/sequence.md) for detailed sequence templates.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Competing on same factors** | Stuck in red ocean | Use ERRC to eliminate/create factors |
| **Differentiation without cost focus** | Not value innovation | Eliminate/reduce while raising/creating |
| **Incrementalism** | No leap in value | Aim for 10x improvement on key factors |
| **Imitating competitors** | Red ocean thinking | Look across six paths for alternatives |
| **Ignoring adoption** | Great idea, no execution | Plan for adoption hurdles upfront |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any strategy:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Does Strategy Canvas show different curve? | Still in red ocean | Apply ERRC framework |
| Are we eliminating AND creating? | Not value innovation | Use all four actions |
| Are we breaking value-cost trade-off? | Traditional competition | Identify over-served factors to cut |
| Are we converting non-customers? | Fighting for share | Map three tiers of non-customers |
| Is there a leap in buyer utility? | Incremental improvement | Aim for 10x on key utility factors |
