description: Review week's progress with concrete accomplishments (not fake percentages), pattern detection, and goal tracking.
---

## Purpose

Create a synthesis of the week reviewing activity, progress, and what was accomplished. **Uses concrete metrics, not vague percentages.**

---

## Data Sources

### 1. Task Progress
- `03-Tasks/Tasks.md` — Task completion status
- `02-Week_Priorities/Week_Priorities.md` — Weekly priorities

### 2. Project Activity
- `04-Projects/**/*.md` — Modified this week

### 3. Meetings & People
- `00-Inbox/Meetings/*.md` — Meeting notes from this week
- `People/**/*.md` — Person pages updated

### 4. Learnings
- `06-Resources/Learnings/**/*.md` — Explicit learnings
- `System/Session_Learnings/*.md` — Auto-captured session learnings

### 5. Daily Reviews
- `07-Archives/Reviews/Daily_Review_YYYY-MM-DD.md` — This week's reviews

### 6. Journals (If Enabled)
- `00-Inbox/Journals/YYYY/MM-Month/` — Morning/evening journals

---

## Analysis Process

### 1. Weekly Priority Completion (Concrete, Not Percentages)

**Don't say:** "Goal X went from 40% to 55%"
**Do say:** "You completed 2 of 3 weekly priorities"

```
Use: get_week_progress()
```

For each weekly priority:
- **Complete:** ✅ What was the deliverable? When did you finish?
- **In Progress:** 🔄 What specifically got done? What's left?
- **Not Started:** ❌ Why? Should it carry forward?

**Surface concrete accomplishments:**

> "**This week's priorities:**
> 
> 1. ✅ **Ship pricing page** — Complete (pushed to prod Wednesday)
>    - Deliverable: New pricing page live at /pricing
>    - Tasks completed: 5 of 5
> 
> 2. 🔄 **Write Q1 strategy doc** — 60% complete
>    - Done: Outline, competitive analysis, recommendations
>    - Remaining: Executive summary, financial projections
>    - 2 tasks left
> 
> 3. ❌ **Customer interviews** — Not started
>    - Reason: Calendar was too stacked
>    - Recommendation: Carry to next week with protected time"

### 2. Task Completion Stats (Concrete Numbers)

Scan `03-Tasks/Tasks.md` for completion timestamps from this week:
- Count tasks completed (look for `✅ YYYY-MM-DD` in date range)
- Count tasks added mid-week
- Count tasks carried over

**Surface:**

> "**Tasks this week:**
> - Completed: 14 tasks
> - Added mid-week: 6 tasks (scope creep?)
> - Carried over: 3 tasks
> 
> **Completion rate:** 82% (14 of 17 planned)"

### 3. Quarterly Goals Progress (Concrete Milestones)

**Don't use fake percentages.** Use milestone counts and specific accomplishments.

```
Use: get_quarterly_goals()
Use: get_goal_status(goal_id) for each goal
```

For each goal:
- Milestones completed this week
- Total milestones done vs. total
- Weeks since last milestone
- Specific accomplishments that moved the goal

> "**Quarterly Goals Progress:**
> 
> | Goal | Milestones | This Week | Status |
> |------|------------|-----------|--------|
> | Launch v2.0 | 3 of 5 | +1 (Pricing page shipped) | On track |
> | Improve NPS | 1 of 4 | No change | ⚠️ Stalled (3 weeks) |
> | Team Capacity | 2 of 3 | No change | On track |
> 
> **Goal 1** advanced because you completed Priority 1.
> **Goal 2** needs attention — no linked work completed this week."

### 4. Daily Completion Rate Trend (NEW)

If daily reviews exist, calculate completion trends:

> "**Daily plan completion this week:**
> 
> | Day | Planned | Done | Rate |
> |-----|---------|------|------|
> | Mon | 3 | 2 | 67% |
> | Tue | 3 | 3 | 100% |
> | Wed | 3 | 2 | 67% |
> | Thu | 3 | 1 | 33% |
> | Fri | 3 | 2 | 67% |
> 
> **Week average:** 67%
> **Pattern:** Thursday was rough (too many meetings?)"

### 5. Meeting Analysis

Review meeting notes from the week:
- Meetings held
- Key decisions
- Action items created
- Follow-ups that might have slipped

### 5.5 Commitment Health Analysis (NEW)

If ScreenPipe and Commitment Detection are available, show aggregate stats:

```
Use: get_commitment_stats(
    start_date="YYYY-MM-DD",  # Monday of this week
    end_date="YYYY-MM-DD"     # Today
)
```

**Surface to user:**

> "📊 **Commitment Health This Week**
>
> **Detected across apps:** 12 potential commitments
> **Already had tasks:** 7 (58%)
> **Created from prompts:** 3
> **Dismissed as handled:** 2
>
> **Apps with most uncaptured asks:**
> 1. Slack - 5 items
> 2. Email - 4 items
> 3. Notion - 3 items
>
> **People who asked most of you:**
> 1. Sarah Chen - 4 asks
> 2. Product team - 3 asks
>
> 💡 *Consider: Check Slack more frequently for asks, or run `/commitment-scan` mid-week*"

**If no commitment data:**
Skip this section silently (user may not have ScreenPipe or commitment detection enabled).

### 6. Learning Compilation & Pattern Detection

Review `System/Session_Learnings/` files from this week:

**Pattern Detection:**
- **Recurring issues:** Same mistake 2+ times? Suggest adding to Mistake_Patterns.md
- **Consistent preferences:** User repeatedly mentioned a workflow preference?

> "This week's session learnings revealed:
> 
> **Recurring Issues:**
> - Calendar overload (mentioned 3 times) — Consider blocking focus time
> 
> **Workflow Preferences:**
> - Prefer morning for deep work (mentioned 2 times)
> 
> Should I add these to your pattern files?"

## Innovation Concierge: Top 3 This Week

At the end of the weekly review, surface the top backlog ideas:

1. Call `list_ideas(status="active", min_score=70)` from Improvements MCP
2. Pick the top 3 ideas by score that haven't been surfaced in the last week review
3. Include in the output format as a section:

```markdown
## 🤖 Top 3 Dex Improvement Ideas

Your AI-curated backlog has surfaced these high-impact ideas:

1. **[idea-XXX]** Title (Score: XX)
   Why now: [Brief evidence or timeliness reason]

2. **[idea-XXX]** Title (Score: XX)
   Why now: [Brief evidence]

3. **[idea-XXX]** Title (Score: XX)
   Why now: [Brief evidence]

> Interested? Run `/dex-improve [idea-id]` to workshop any of these.
> Run `/dex-backlog` to see the full ranked backlog.
```

**Rules:**
- Only show ideas with score >= 70 (don't surface low-value noise)
- Prefer ideas with recent "Why Now?" evidence
- If fewer than 3 qualifying ideas, show however many exist
- If no qualifying ideas, skip this section entirely
- This is a gentle nudge, not a sales pitch

## Follow-up Actions

After synthesis:
1. Update Tasks.md with new priorities
2. Archive completed items
3. Update project pages with status changes
4. Offer to run `/week-plan` for next week

## Track Usage (Silent)

Update `System/usage_log.md` to mark weekly review as used.

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `week_review_completed` and properties:
- `priorities_completed`: number of priorities completed
- `priorities_total`: total number of priorities
- `tasks_completed`: number of tasks completed this weekThis only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".
