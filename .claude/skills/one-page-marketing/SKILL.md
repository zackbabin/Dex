# The 1-Page Marketing Plan Framework

A complete marketing system captured on a single page. Instead of a 50-page marketing plan that never gets executed, the 1-Page Marketing Plan distills everything into a 3x3 grid of nine squares — each representing a critical stage in turning a stranger into a raving fan. Fill in all nine squares and you have a living, breathing marketing engine that drives predictable growth.

## Core Principle

**"Marketing is not an event — it is a process."**

Most businesses treat marketing as a series of disconnected tactics: run an ad here, post on social media there, attend a trade show when the budget allows. The 1-Page Marketing Plan replaces this randomness with a structured, sequential process built around three phases of the customer journey:

1. **BEFORE** — The prospect does not yet know you exist. Your job is to identify exactly who they are, craft a message that resonates, and place that message in the media they consume.
2. **DURING** — The prospect is now aware of you and becomes a lead. Your job is to capture their information, nurture the relationship, and convert them into a paying customer.
3. **AFTER** — The person is now a customer. Your job is to deliver a world-class experience, maximize their lifetime value, and turn them into a referral source.

Each phase contains three squares, giving you nine total building blocks. When all nine work together, you have a marketing machine — not a collection of tactics.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10**

Rate your marketing plan from 0 to 10 based on how completely and specifically you have filled in all nine squares of the grid. A score of 10 means every square contains specific, actionable content — named target segments, a written USP, identified media channels with budgets, a designed lead magnet, a mapped nurture sequence, a defined sales process, a documented customer experience, an ascension model with pricing tiers, and a referral system with scripts and tracking.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0-3   | Fragmented tactics, no cohesive plan, significant gaps |
| 4-6   | Some squares filled but vague; missing key phases (usually AFTER) |
| 7-8   | All squares addressed with reasonable specificity; some lack detail |
| 9-10  | Every square contains specific, measurable, actionable content ready for execution |

## BEFORE Phase (Prospect to Lead)

### 1. Target Market

**Core concept:** Use the PVP Index (Personal fulfillment, Value to marketplace, Profitability) to select a niche you can dominate. Stop trying to sell to everyone. The riches are in the niches.

**Why it works:** When you narrow your focus, your message becomes more specific, your offer becomes more relevant, and your cost of acquisition drops. A specialist always commands higher fees and deeper trust than a generalist.

**Key insights:**
- Score potential niches on three dimensions: Personal fulfillment (do you enjoy serving them?), Value to marketplace (do they urgently need what you offer?), Profitability (can they pay and will they pay enough?)
- Create a detailed ideal customer avatar — demographics, psychographics, pain points, desires, watering holes
- Go narrow enough that your target market feels like you are speaking directly to them
- "If you speak to everyone, you speak to no one"
- One niche does not mean one product; it means one marketing message to one audience

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS startup | Score 3 potential ICP segments using PVP Index | Chose "mid-market e-commerce" over "all online businesses" |
| Local service business | Define geographic + demographic niche | "Homeowners 35-55 in the North Shore with pools" |
| Freelancer/consultant | Pick an industry vertical to own | "B2B fintech content marketing" instead of "marketing" |
| E-commerce brand | Identify psychographic tribe | "Minimalist urban professionals" not "people who like bags" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "We work exclusively with [niche] who struggle with [specific problem]"
- "The only [product/service] designed specifically for [target market]"
- "Unlike generic solutions, this was built from the ground up for [niche]"

**Ethical boundary:** Niche selection must be based on genuine ability to serve the market well, not on targeting vulnerable populations for exploitation.

See: `references/target-market.md`

### 2. Craft Your Message

**Core concept:** Your message must answer one question: "Why should I buy from you rather than your nearest competitor?" This answer is your Unique Selling Proposition (USP). Without it, you are a commodity competing solely on price.

**Why it works:** A clear USP gives prospects a reason to choose you, gives your marketing a consistent theme, and eliminates the need to compete on price. It transforms your business from "one of many" to "the only one."

**Key insights:**
- Your USP is not a slogan — it is a position in the market that you can defend and prove
- Build your USP around one of: specialization, a unique mechanism, a bold guarantee, a proprietary process, or an underserved niche
- Your elevator pitch should be completable in under 30 seconds: "You know how [target market] struggles with [problem]? What we do is [solution], so that [outcome]."
- Test your message — if you replace your company name with a competitor's and it still works, your message is too generic
- The commodity trap: if prospects cannot tell the difference between you and competitors, the only differentiator left is price

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS product | Define the unique mechanism | "The only CRM that auto-generates follow-up emails using your voice tone" |
| Agency | Create a proprietary process | "Our 5-Phase Growth Sprint" — named, trademarked, diagrammed |
| Retail brand | Craft a bold guarantee | "If your shoes wear out in under 2 years, we replace them free" |
| Professional service | Build authority positioning | "The tax firm that has saved mid-market retailers $47M since 2018" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "You know how [target] struggles with [pain]? We [solution] so they can [outcome]."
- "The only [category] that [unique differentiator]"
- "We guarantee [specific result] or [risk reversal]"
- "[Specific number] [target market] have used [product] to achieve [result]"

**Ethical boundary:** Your USP must be truthful and deliverable. Never claim results you cannot substantiate or make guarantees you have no intention of honoring.

See: `references/craft-message.md`

### 3. Advertising Media

**Core concept:** Use direct response marketing principles for every advertising dollar you spend. Every ad must be trackable, measurable, and designed to generate a specific response — not "brand awareness." Choose media channels where your target market actually spends time.

**Why it works:** Direct response marketing eliminates waste. Instead of hoping people remember your brand, you ask them to take a specific action right now, and you measure whether they did. This turns marketing from a cost center into a profit center.

**Key insights:**
- Apply the direct response trinity: trackable, measurable, calls to specific action
- Select channels based on where your target market actually is, not what is trendy
- Start with one channel, master it, then expand — do not spread thin across five platforms simultaneously
- Track Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) per channel and compare to Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- The best media channel is the one where you can reach your target market at an acceptable CAC
- Organic and paid work together — organic builds authority, paid buys speed
- Attribution matters: know which dollar produced which result

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| B2B SaaS | LinkedIn ads + content marketing | Targeted decision-maker roles with lead magnet ads |
| Local business | Google Ads + direct mail | "Plumber near me" search ads plus neighborhood postcards |
| E-commerce | Meta ads + email | Lookalike audiences from best customers, retargeting with email |
| Professional services | Podcast guesting + SEO | Authority-building through niche podcasts, capture via blog content |

**Copy patterns:**
- Every ad should have: a headline that calls out the target, a compelling offer, a clear call to action, a tracking mechanism
- "Attention [target market]: [headline about their pain/desire]"
- "Call [tracked number] / Visit [tracked URL] to claim your [specific offer]"

**Ethical boundary:** All advertising must be truthful and comply with platform policies and local advertising regulations. Never use deceptive claims or bait-and-switch tactics.

See: `references/advertising-media.md`

## DURING Phase (Lead to Customer)

### 4. Capture Leads

**Core concept:** The goal of your marketing is not to make an immediate sale — it is to build a database of interested prospects. Use lead magnets to exchange value for contact information. Your database is the most valuable asset in your business.

**Why it works:** Only about 3% of any market is ready to buy right now. If your marketing only targets that 3%, you miss the other 97% who will buy later. Lead capture lets you stay in contact with the full market and sell to them when they are ready.

**Key insights:**
- A lead magnet offers something of genuine value in exchange for contact information
- The best lead magnets solve a specific, immediate problem for your target market
- Speed-to-lead is critical: respond within 5 minutes and your conversion rate skyrockets
- Use a CRM from day one — even a simple one. Do not rely on memory, spreadsheets, or sticky notes
- Your opt-in page has one job: get the visitor to exchange their contact info for your lead magnet
- Lead scoring helps you prioritize which leads to focus on first

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS | Free trial or interactive tool | "Free website audit — get your score in 60 seconds" |
| Consultant | Downloadable framework or checklist | "The 7-Point Financial Health Checklist for Clinic Owners" |
| E-commerce | Quiz or discount | "Find your perfect mattress — take our 2-minute sleep quiz" |
| Local service | Free estimate or inspection | "Free 15-point roof inspection — book online in 30 seconds" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Download the free [resource] that shows you how to [desired result]"
- "Take the free [quiz/assessment] and discover your [score/type/result]"
- "Get instant access to [resource] — no credit card required"

**Ethical boundary:** Always deliver on the promise of the lead magnet. Never use deceptive opt-in tactics or sell contact information to third parties without explicit consent.

See: `references/capture-leads.md`

### 5. Nurture Leads

**Core concept:** Most leads are not ready to buy immediately. Lead nurturing is the process of building a relationship over time through consistent value delivery, education, and trust-building until the prospect is ready to purchase.

**Why it works:** People buy from those they know, like, and trust. Nurturing accelerates the know-like-trust cycle by positioning you as a helpful authority rather than a pushy salesperson. It keeps you top-of-mind so when the prospect is finally ready, you are the obvious choice.

**Key insights:**
- The welcome sequence is the most important: it sets expectations and builds the initial relationship
- Follow a content cadence: educate, entertain, inspire, then offer (roughly 3:1 value-to-ask ratio)
- Use multiple channels — email is the backbone, but reinforce with retargeting ads, social media, direct mail, SMS
- Segment your list based on behavior (what they clicked, downloaded, viewed) not just demographics
- Automation makes nurture scalable, but personalization makes it effective
- The fortune is in the follow-up — most sales happen after the 5th-12th contact

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS | Onboarding email sequence + in-app messages | 7-day welcome series showing one feature per day |
| Consultant | Weekly newsletter + case studies | "Friday Insights" email with one actionable tip per week |
| E-commerce | Browse abandonment + cart abandonment sequences | "Still thinking about it?" email with social proof |
| Local service | Seasonal reminder emails + SMS | "Spring is here — time for your annual AC check-up" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Here is the #1 mistake [target market] makes with [topic] — and how to fix it"
- "How [client name] went from [before state] to [after state] in [time period]"
- "I noticed you downloaded [lead magnet]. Here is the next step..."

**Ethical boundary:** Always provide an easy, one-click unsubscribe. Never mislead about email frequency. Respect communication preferences and comply with anti-spam regulations.

See: `references/nurture-leads.md`

### 6. Sales Conversion

**Core concept:** Conversion is the process of turning a nurtured lead into a paying customer. It requires removing friction, overcoming objections, building trust through social proof and guarantees, and making it as easy as possible to say yes.

**Why it works:** Even the best leads need a clear path to purchase. Pricing psychology, risk reversal, and structured sales processes dramatically increase conversion rates by addressing the real reasons people hesitate: fear of making a mistake, lack of trust, and confusion about the next step.

**Key insights:**
- Price communicates value — do not undercharge. Premium pricing attracts premium clients
- Use risk reversal (guarantees, free trials, money-back promises) to shift risk from buyer to seller
- The most common objections are predictable: address them proactively in your sales materials
- Structure your sales conversations: rapport, discovery, presentation, objection handling, close
- Make the buying process simple — every extra step loses customers
- Social proof (testimonials, case studies, reviews) is more persuasive than anything you say about yourself
- Proposals should be designed to sell, not just inform

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS | Free trial to paid conversion flow | 14-day trial with guided onboarding, upgrade prompt at "aha moment" |
| Consultant | Discovery call to proposal pipeline | 30-min discovery call, custom proposal within 24 hours |
| E-commerce | Optimized checkout with trust signals | One-page checkout, money-back guarantee badge, real-time support chat |
| Local service | Estimate to booking process | Same-day estimate, instant online booking, "price lock" guarantee |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Try it free for [X] days. If you don't [specific result], you pay nothing."
- "Join [number] [target market] who have already [achieved result]"
- "Here is exactly what you get: [detailed value stack]"
- "Your investment is protected by our [guarantee name]"

**Ethical boundary:** Never use high-pressure tactics, artificial scarcity (false deadlines/limited quantities), or manipulative closing techniques. The sale should be a natural outcome of demonstrated value and genuine fit.

See: `references/sales-conversion.md`

## AFTER Phase (Customer to Raving Fan)

### 7. World-Class Experience

**Core concept:** The sale is not the finish line — it is the starting line. Delivering a world-class experience turns customers into a tribe of loyal advocates. Use systems and technology to ensure consistency, and design intentional "moments of truth" that surprise and delight.

**Why it works:** Customer experience is the ultimate competitive moat. Products can be copied, prices can be undercut, but a remarkable experience creates emotional loyalty that competitors cannot replicate. It also dramatically reduces churn and increases lifetime value.

**Key insights:**
- Map every touchpoint in the customer journey and identify "moments of truth" — the interactions that disproportionately shape perception
- Build systems (checklists, SOPs, automation) so the experience is consistent regardless of who delivers it
- Create a tribe — customers who feel part of a community have dramatically higher retention
- The "wow factor" does not have to be expensive; it has to be unexpected and personal
- Use technology to automate the routine so your team can focus on the human touches that matter
- Measure experience with Net Promoter Score (NPS) and act on the feedback

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS | Structured onboarding + proactive support | Welcome video from founder, 30-day check-in call, quarterly business reviews |
| Consultant | Client delivery framework with milestone celebrations | "Phase Complete" celebration emails, handwritten thank-you notes |
| E-commerce | Unboxing experience + post-purchase communication | Custom packaging, surprise sample, handwritten card, "how to get the most from your purchase" email |
| Local service | Service delivery ritual + follow-up | Uniformed team, floor mats at entry, same-day follow-up call asking "how did we do?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Welcome to the [brand] family. Here is what happens next..."
- "We just completed [milestone]. Here is what we found and what is next."
- "You have been a customer for [X months]. We wanted to say thank you with [surprise]."

**Ethical boundary:** Customer experience systems must genuinely serve the customer, not create lock-in or switching costs that trap them. Always make it easy to leave — that confidence is what makes them stay.

See: `references/customer-experience.md`

### 8. Increase Lifetime Value

**Core concept:** The most expensive sale is the first one. Once someone is a customer, increasing their lifetime value through upsells, cross-sells, an ascension model, and retention strategies is the highest-leverage activity in your business.

**Why it works:** Acquiring a new customer costs 5-25x more than retaining an existing one. Increasing customer retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25-95%. Your existing customers already know, like, and trust you — selling more to them is dramatically easier than finding new buyers.

**Key insights:**
- Design an ascension model: low-ticket entry offer, mid-ticket core offer, high-ticket premium offer, ultra-premium tier
- Raising prices is the simplest path to higher LTV — most businesses are undercharging
- Reactivation campaigns to lapsed customers are among the highest-ROI marketing activities
- Track LTV by segment, channel, and cohort — not just as a single average number
- Subscription and recurring revenue models dramatically increase predictable LTV
- Cross-sell and upsell at the point of maximum satisfaction (right after a win or positive experience)

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS | Tiered pricing + usage-based expansion | Free trial, Starter $49/mo, Pro $149/mo, Enterprise custom |
| Consultant | Engagement ladder | One-time audit $2K, quarterly retainer $5K/mo, fractional CMO $15K/mo |
| E-commerce | Subscription + complementary products | One-time purchase, subscribe-and-save 15% off, bundles, accessories |
| Local service | Annual plans + add-on services | Single service visit, annual maintenance plan, premium plan with priority scheduling |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Customers who add [upsell] typically see [X%] better results"
- "Upgrade to [tier] and unlock [specific benefit they care about]"
- "We noticed you haven't [used product/visited] in a while. Here is a special reason to come back."
- "Based on your [purchase/usage], you might also benefit from [cross-sell]"

**Ethical boundary:** Upsells must genuinely benefit the customer. Never upsell products or services the customer does not need simply to inflate revenue. The ascension model should reflect increasing value, not just increasing price.

See: `references/lifetime-value.md`

### 9. Orchestrate Referrals

**Core concept:** Do not leave referrals to chance. Design a systematic referral program that makes it easy, rewarding, and natural for happy customers to send new business your way. Also pursue strategic partnerships and joint ventures for exponential reach.

**Why it works:** Referred customers have higher conversion rates, higher lifetime value, lower acquisition costs, and shorter sales cycles than any other source. A recommendation from a trusted friend or colleague is more persuasive than any ad you could ever run. Yet most businesses never proactively ask for referrals.

**Key insights:**
- The #1 reason customers do not refer is that they are never asked — not that they would not want to
- Ask at the moment of peak satisfaction (right after a win, positive review, or compliment)
- Make referring easy — provide exact language, shareable links, and simple mechanics
- Reward both the referrer and the referred (two-sided incentives)
- Track referral sources religiously so you know which customers and partners generate the most referrals
- Joint ventures and partnerships let you borrow the trust of a complementary business
- Create a formal affiliate or referral partner program for your best advocates

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SaaS | In-app referral program | "Invite a friend, you both get 1 month free" with one-click sharing |
| Consultant | Strategic partnership network | Reciprocal referral agreements with complementary service providers |
| E-commerce | Ambassador program | Top customers get a personal referral code with 15% commission |
| Local service | Referral cards + review requests | Physical referral cards with QR code, automated post-service review request |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Know someone who could benefit from [specific result]? Share this and you both get [incentive]."
- "You mentioned you are happy with [result]. Would you be open to sharing that experience with [specific person/type of person]?"
- "As a thank you for your referral, here is [reward]."
- "We have a partnership with [trusted brand]. Their customers get [special offer]."

**Ethical boundary:** Referral incentives must be transparent and disclosed. Never incentivize dishonest reviews or recommendations. Referral programs should benefit all three parties: the referrer, the referred, and your business.

See: `references/referral-systems.md`

## Direct Response Principles

These cross-cutting principles apply across all nine squares:

| Principle | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Trackable | Every marketing action must be measurable | Use unique URLs, phone numbers, promo codes per channel |
| Measurable | Know the ROI of every dollar spent | Calculate CAC, LTV, conversion rates per channel and campaign |
| Uses compelling headlines | Grab attention with benefit-driven headlines | Lead with the outcome the prospect desires, not your product features |
| Targets a specific audience | Speak to one person, not everyone | Use language, examples, and references specific to your niche |
| Makes a specific offer | Tell people exactly what to do next | "Download the guide," "Book your call," "Start your trial" |
| Demands a response | Create urgency and a reason to act now | Genuine deadlines, limited availability, fast-action bonuses |
| Includes multi-step follow-up | One touch is never enough | Automated sequences across email, retargeting, phone, direct mail |
| Delivers value first | Lead with generosity, not a sales pitch | Free content, tools, assessments before asking for money |
| Has a backend | The real profit is in the second and third sale | Design your product ladder before your first campaign |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Targeting everyone | Dilutes message, inflates acquisition cost, creates generic marketing | Use PVP Index to select one niche and dominate it before expanding |
| No USP — competing on price | Attracts price-sensitive buyers, destroys margins, creates a race to the bottom | Develop a genuine USP based on specialization, unique mechanism, or bold guarantee |
| Running brand awareness ads with no tracking | No way to measure ROI, no accountability, money disappears | Apply direct response principles to every ad: track, measure, call to action |
| No lead capture — sending traffic to home page | 97% of visitors are not ready to buy now and leave forever | Create lead magnets and dedicated landing pages to capture contact info |
| Ignoring existing customers | Missing the highest-ROI marketing (retention and upsells) | Build the AFTER phase: experience, LTV, and referral systems |
| No follow-up system | Leads go cold, opportunities die, money is left on the table | Implement automated nurture sequences and a CRM from day one |

## Quick Diagnostic

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Can you describe your ideal customer in one specific paragraph? | Your targeting is too broad | Complete the PVP Index and ideal customer avatar worksheet |
| Can you complete this sentence: "We are the only _____ that _____"? | You lack a USP | Work through the USP creation process in the message reference |
| Do you know your Customer Acquisition Cost per channel? | You are flying blind on media spend | Set up tracking for every channel and calculate CAC weekly |
| Do you have a lead magnet that converts at 20%+ on your landing page? | Your lead capture is underperforming | Test new lead magnets and optimize your opt-in page |
| Do you have an automated email sequence of 5+ emails for new leads? | Leads are going cold without nurture | Build a welcome sequence using the templates in the nurture reference |
| Do you proactively ask for referrals with a script and system? | You are leaving your best acquisition channel to chance | Design a referral program using the frameworks in the referral reference |
