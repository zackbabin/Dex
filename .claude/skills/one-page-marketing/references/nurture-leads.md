# Nurture Leads

Most leads are not ready to buy when they first encounter your business. Lead nurturing is the systematic process of building a relationship over time through consistent value delivery, education, and trust-building. The goal is to stay top-of-mind so that when the prospect is ready to buy, you are the obvious and only choice.

## Why Nurturing Works

People buy from businesses they know, like, and trust. Nurturing accelerates this cycle.

| Stage | What It Means | How Nurturing Builds It |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| Know | The prospect is aware you exist | Consistent presence across channels; repeated helpful touchpoints |
| Like | The prospect has a positive impression of you | Valuable content, authentic personality, relevance to their world |
| Trust | The prospect believes you can deliver on your promises | Case studies, social proof, demonstrated expertise, consistency over time |

### The Follow-Up Fortune

Research consistently shows that most sales happen after multiple contacts:

| Number of Contacts | Percentage of Sales |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1st contact | 2% |
| 2nd contact | 3% |
| 3rd contact | 5% |
| 4th contact | 10% |
| 5th-12th contact | 80% |

Yet 48% of salespeople never follow up after the first contact, and 90% give up after the fourth. A systematic nurture process ensures you never drop the ball on follow-up.

## Email Sequence Templates

Email is the backbone of lead nurturing. Here are four essential sequences every business should have, with templates for each.

### Sequence 1: Welcome Sequence (Days 1-7)

The welcome sequence fires immediately after a lead opts in. It sets expectations, delivers the lead magnet, and begins the relationship.

| Email | Timing | Purpose | Subject Line Template |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| Email 1 | Immediate | Deliver the lead magnet + set expectations | "Here is your [lead magnet name]" |
| Email 2 | Day 1 | Share your origin story or brand mission | "Why I started [business/this work]" |
| Email 3 | Day 2 | Provide a quick win related to the lead magnet topic | "Try this today: [one actionable tip]" |
| Email 4 | Day 4 | Share a case study or success story | "How [client/customer] went from [before] to [after]" |
| Email 5 | Day 6 | Address the #1 objection or misconception | "The biggest myth about [topic]" |
| Email 6 | Day 7 | Make a soft offer or invite to next step | "Ready for the next step? Here is how we can help" |

**Welcome Email 1 Template:**

```
Subject: Here is your [Lead Magnet Name]

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for requesting [Lead Magnet Name]. Here is your download link:

[LINK]

Here is what I recommend: [One specific action they should take
with the lead magnet right now].

These emails will help you [desired outcome].

If you have any questions, just reply to this email. I read every
response.

[Your Name]
[Your Company]

P.S. [One additional tip or resource related to the lead magnet]
```

### Sequence 2: Education Sequence (Weeks 2-6)

After the welcome sequence, transition to a weekly or bi-weekly cadence that educates and builds authority.

| Email | Focus | Content Type |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Week 2 | Teaching | "The 3 biggest mistakes [target market] makes with [topic]" |
| Week 3 | Framework | "Our [named framework] for [achieving result]" |
| Week 4 | Social proof | "Case study: [Client name] achieved [specific result]" |
| Week 5 | Myth-busting | "Why [common belief] is actually wrong — and what to do instead" |
| Week 6 | How-to | "Step-by-step: How to [solve a specific problem they have]" |

### Sequence 3: Case Study Sequence (Targeted)

Triggered when a lead shows buying signals (visits pricing page, downloads buyer-stage content, or reaches a certain lead score).

| Email | Timing | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Email 1 | Trigger +0 | Short case study: "[Client] achieved [result] in [time]" |
| Email 2 | Trigger +2 days | Detailed breakdown of the process and how it could apply to them |
| Email 3 | Trigger +4 days | "Here is what working with us actually looks like" (process walkthrough) |
| Email 4 | Trigger +6 days | FAQ addressing common buying objections |
| Email 5 | Trigger +8 days | Direct invitation to book a call/start a trial/make a purchase |

### Sequence 4: Offer Sequence (Promotion)

Used for time-limited promotions, launches, or when you want to drive conversions from your warm list.

| Email | Timing | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Email 1 | Day 1 | Announce the offer — what it is, who it is for, why now |
| Email 2 | Day 2 | Social proof — testimonials, case studies, results |
| Email 3 | Day 3 | Objection handling — address the top 3 reasons people hesitate |
| Email 4 | Day 4 | Bonus or incentive — add extra value for fast action |
| Email 5 | Day 5 (final) | Last chance — deadline reminder, urgency, final CTA |

## Content Cadence

The ratio of value to asks determines whether your audience stays engaged or unsubscribes. Follow the 3:1 rule.

### The 3:1 Rule

For every promotional email (asking for a sale, a call, a demo), send at least three value emails (teaching, inspiring, entertaining). This ensures your list sees you as a valuable resource, not a constant salesperson.

### Content Types and Their Roles

| Content Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Educational | Teach something useful; build authority | Weekly |
| Inspirational | Share success stories and possibilities | Bi-weekly |
| Entertaining | Show personality; build likability | Weekly to bi-weekly |
| Promotional | Make an offer; drive conversions | Monthly or less |
| Conversational | Ask questions; encourage replies; build connection | Bi-weekly |

### Sample Monthly Email Calendar

| Week | Monday Email | Thursday Email |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Week 1 | Educational: "3 ways to improve [X]" | Conversational: "What is your biggest challenge with [X]?" |
| Week 2 | Case study: "[Client] results" | Educational: "How to avoid [common mistake]" |
| Week 3 | Inspirational: Industry trends and opportunities | Entertaining: Behind-the-scenes or personal story |
| Week 4 | Educational: Framework or how-to | Promotional: Offer or CTA |

## Multi-Channel Nurture

Email is the backbone, but the most effective nurture systems use multiple channels to reinforce the message and stay top-of-mind.

### Channel Integration Map

| Channel | Role in Nurture | Cadence | Integration |
|---------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Email | Primary nurture — education, stories, offers | 1-3x per week | Foundation of all nurture |
| Retargeting ads | Reinforce key messages to engaged leads | Ongoing for 30-90 days | Show ads to email openers and website visitors |
| Social media | Build familiarity and social proof | Daily posts, weekly engagement | Share email content in social format |
| SMS | High-urgency or time-sensitive communications | Sparingly — 1-2x per month max | Event reminders, deadline alerts, exclusive offers |
| Direct mail | High-impact touchpoint for high-value leads | 1x per quarter for VIP segments | Personalized cards, printed resources, lumpy mail |
| Phone/Video | Personal connection for sales-ready leads | As triggered by lead score | Sales follow-up, check-in calls |
| Podcast/Video content | Deep authority building | Weekly or bi-weekly | Reference in emails, repurpose as social content |

### The Multi-Touch Sequence Example

Here is how multiple channels work together for a single lead over 14 days:

| Day | Channel | Touchpoint |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Day 1 | Email | Welcome email with lead magnet |
| Day 1 | Retargeting | Facebook/Instagram ad with a related tip |
| Day 2 | Email | Quick win email |
| Day 3 | Social | Organic post about the topic they opted in for |
| Day 5 | Email | Case study email |
| Day 5 | Retargeting | Ad featuring the case study result |
| Day 7 | Email | Education email |
| Day 7 | SMS | "Hey [Name], did you have a chance to check out [lead magnet]? Reply with any questions!" |
| Day 10 | Email | Address #1 objection |
| Day 12 | Email | Soft offer or invitation |
| Day 14 | Retargeting | Ad with offer/CTA |
| Day 14 | Phone | Call from sales (if lead score is above threshold) |

## Segmentation

Sending the same message to every lead is a missed opportunity. Segmentation lets you tailor messages to specific groups, dramatically increasing relevance and conversion.

### Segmentation Criteria

| Criteria | What It Means | Example Segments |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Lead source | Where they came from | Google Ads leads vs. referral leads vs. content leads |
| Lead magnet | Which resource they downloaded | "Pricing Guide" downloaders vs. "Beginner Checklist" downloaders |
| Engagement level | How actively they interact with your content | Opened 5+ emails in last 30 days vs. no opens in 60 days |
| Purchase history | What they have bought (or not) | Customers vs. non-customers; one-time vs. repeat buyers |
| Behavioral signals | Specific actions they have taken | Visited pricing page, attended webinar, requested demo |
| Profile data | Who they are | Industry, company size, role, location |
| Stage in journey | Where they are in your funnel | New lead, marketing qualified, sales qualified, opportunity |

### Segmentation in Practice

Start with three basic segments and expand from there:

1. **New leads (0-14 days):** Receive welcome sequence, high-value content, building the relationship
2. **Engaged leads (14+ days, active):** Receive ongoing nurture content, case studies, and periodic offers
3. **Cold leads (30+ days, no engagement):** Receive re-engagement sequence, then move to lower frequency or remove from list

## Automation

Automation makes nurture scalable without sacrificing personalization. Here are the essential automations every business should implement.

### Essential Automations

| Automation | Trigger | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Welcome sequence | Lead opts in | Send 5-7 email welcome series |
| Lead scoring update | Email open, click, page visit | Update lead score in CRM |
| Hot lead alert | Lead score exceeds threshold | Notify sales team for personal follow-up |
| Re-engagement | No opens in 30 days | Send "We miss you" sequence (3 emails) |
| Behavior-triggered content | Visits specific page | Send relevant case study or resource |
| Post-purchase | Customer makes purchase | Move to customer nurture track |
| Anniversary/milestone | Date-based trigger | Send personalized celebration or check-in |

### Automation Best Practices

- **Start simple.** Build the welcome sequence first. Add complexity only after the basics are working.
- **Always have an exit.** Every automated sequence should have conditions to stop — for example, stop the nurture sequence if the lead becomes a customer.
- **Monitor performance.** Review open rates, click rates, and unsubscribe rates monthly. Declining metrics signal content fatigue.
- **Personalize meaningfully.** Use first name, reference their lead magnet, mention their industry or role. Avoid fake personalization that feels creepy.
- **Test subject lines.** The subject line determines whether the email gets opened. A/B test every subject line when your list is large enough (100+ per variant).

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Welcome Sequence Draft

Write your 6-email welcome sequence using the template above. Include actual subject lines, opening lines, and key content for each email. Send it to yourself and read it as if you were a new lead.

### Exercise 2: Content Calendar

Create a 4-week email calendar using the sample monthly calendar as a template. Fill in actual topics relevant to your target market. Schedule it in your email platform.

### Exercise 3: Multi-Channel Mapping

Map your current nurture channels. Which channels are you using? Which are you missing? Pick one new channel to add this month and define how it integrates with email.

### Exercise 4: Segmentation Audit

Look at your current email list. How is it segmented? If it is not segmented at all, identify the three most impactful segments you could create this week and set them up.

### Exercise 5: Automation Setup

If you have no automation, set up your welcome sequence this week. If you already have a welcome sequence, identify the next highest-impact automation from the Essential Automations table and implement it.
