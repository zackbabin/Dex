# Unique Attributes Discovery

Unique attributes are the objective, verifiable facts about your product that no competitive alternative can claim. They are the raw material of differentiation — without genuine unique attributes, positioning becomes a messaging exercise built on nothing. This reference guides you through a rigorous process for identifying, verifying, and clustering your unique attributes.

## What Counts as a Unique Attribute

A unique attribute must pass two tests:

1. **The Uniqueness Test:** "Only we [attribute]." If a competitive alternative can make the same claim, it's not unique — it's table stakes.
2. **The Truth Test:** The attribute must be objectively verifiable. If it requires subjective judgment ("we're the easiest to use"), it needs to be backed by measurable evidence.

### Attribute Categories

Unique attributes extend far beyond product features. Consider all of the following:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Product Features** | Specific capabilities of the product | Real-time multiplayer editing, built-in compliance templates, native video recording |
| **Architecture/Technology** | How the product is built | Graph database architecture, edge computing, on-device processing |
| **Data/Network Effects** | Advantages from your user base or data | Trained on 10M+ customer conversations, marketplace with 50K providers |
| **Integrations** | Connections to other tools | Only solution with native bi-directional Salesforce sync |
| **Business Model** | How you charge or deliver | Usage-based pricing, no long-term contracts, freemium with unlimited users |
| **Expertise/Team** | Unique knowledge or experience | Founded by former CFOs, team includes 3 former NASA engineers |
| **Process/Methodology** | Your approach to solving the problem | Proprietary scoring algorithm, patented matching methodology |
| **Community/Ecosystem** | User community, partner ecosystem | Active community of 100K practitioners, certified partner network in 40 countries |
| **Company Characteristics** | Facts about your company | Only vendor headquartered in the EU (data sovereignty), SOC 2 Type II certified |

## Feature vs. Attribute Distinction

A common mistake is conflating features with attributes. Understanding the difference is critical:

- **Feature:** A specific thing your product does. ("We have a dashboard.")
- **Attribute:** A quality of that feature that is unique. ("Our dashboard updates in real-time with sub-second latency from 200+ data sources simultaneously.")

Features are commodity elements that many products share. Attributes are the specific characteristics that make your implementation unique. During the discovery process, always push past "we have X" to "our X is unique because Y."

### Examples of the Distinction

| Feature (Not Unique) | Attribute (Potentially Unique) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Reporting | Reports generated in natural language, not just charts and tables |
| Mobile app | Mobile app works fully offline with automatic sync when reconnected |
| AI-powered | AI model trained exclusively on [specific domain] data from 10 years of [specific] interactions |
| Customer support | 24/7 support with guaranteed 15-minute response time backed by SLA credits |
| Integrations | The only platform with a certified, bi-directional integration with SAP S/4HANA |

## Attribute Discovery Workshop

This is a structured process for identifying unique attributes as a team. It should include people from product, engineering, sales, customer success, and marketing.

### Preparation (1 Week Before)

**Gather inputs:**
- Competitive alternatives list (from Step 1 of the positioning process)
- Competitor feature comparison matrix (if available)
- Win/loss analysis summaries
- Customer interview transcripts or summaries
- Product roadmap and recent release notes
- Customer support ticket themes (what do customers praise vs. complain about)
- G2/Capterra/review site summaries

**Pre-work for participants:**
Ask each participant to come prepared with answers to:
1. "What do our happiest customers tell us they can't get anywhere else?"
2. "What do we build or do that competitors can't or won't copy easily?"
3. "What did we invest heavily in that others didn't?"

### Workshop Agenda (90 Minutes)

**Phase 1: Brainstorm (25 minutes)**

Each participant writes attributes on sticky notes — one attribute per note. Encourage quantity over quality at this stage. Use the attribute categories table above as prompts.

Facilitation tips:
- Go around the room and have each person share one attribute at a time
- Build on each other's ideas — "That reminds me, we also..."
- No evaluation during this phase — capture everything
- Prompt with questions: "What about our architecture? Our team? Our data? Our business model?"

**Phase 2: Uniqueness Verification (25 minutes)**

For each attribute, apply the Uniqueness Test:

| Verification Question | Pass | Fail |
|----------------------|------|------|
| Can any competitive alternative make this exact claim? | No → Keep | Yes → Remove |
| Is this objectively verifiable or just an opinion? | Verifiable → Keep | Opinion → Need evidence |
| Would a customer be able to confirm this attribute? | Yes → Keep | No → Rephrase or remove |
| Has this been true for at least 6 months (not a temporary advantage)? | Yes → Strong | No → Flag as fragile |

**Process:**
1. Read each attribute aloud
2. The group debates: "Can [alternative A] claim this? What about [alternative B]?"
3. If even one competitive alternative can make the claim, it's not unique — move it to a "table stakes" list
4. If the group isn't sure, mark it for follow-up research

**Phase 3: Evidence Collection (15 minutes)**

For each surviving attribute, document the evidence:

| Attribute | Evidence Type | Specific Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Real-time processing of 200+ data sources | Technical spec | Architecture documentation, benchmark tests |
| Only vendor with SOC 2 + HIPAA + FedRAMP | Certification | Certificates on file, listed on compliance registries |
| Founded by 3 former hospital CMOs | Company fact | Founder bios, LinkedIn profiles |
| 98.5% customer retention rate | Metric | Internal data, can be verified by reference customers |

**Phase 4: Clustering (15 minutes)**

Group related attributes into clusters. These clusters will become the foundation for value themes in Step 3.

**Clustering guidelines:**
- Look for attributes that serve the same customer need
- Typically 3-5 clusters emerge naturally
- Name each cluster with a phrase that captures the theme
- Each cluster should have 2-5 attributes

**Example clustering:**

| Cluster Name | Attributes in Cluster |
|-------------|----------------------|
| "Purpose-built for healthcare" | HIPAA certified, founded by CMOs, medical terminology NLP, EHR integrations |
| "Real-time intelligence" | Sub-second data processing, 200+ data source connectors, live anomaly detection |
| "Enterprise-grade reliability" | 99.99% uptime SLA, SOC 2 Type II, dedicated customer success manager |

**Phase 5: Prioritize (10 minutes)**

Not all unique attributes matter equally. Rank clusters by:
1. How much customers care about this (based on interview data and win/loss analysis)
2. How defensible this advantage is (how hard it is for competitors to copy)
3. How verifiable and provable this is (easy to demonstrate vs. hard to prove)

## Uniqueness Verification Techniques

Beyond the workshop, use these techniques to verify that attributes are genuinely unique:

### Technique 1: The Competitor Test
Visit each competitive alternative's website, demo their product, or talk to their customers. Can they make the same claim? If their marketing says something similar, is the underlying reality the same?

### Technique 2: The Customer Confirmation Test
Ask 5 customers: "Is [attribute] something you can get from [alternative]?" If customers say "yes" or "I'm not sure," the attribute isn't perceived as unique even if it technically is.

### Technique 3: The Time Horizon Test
How long would it take a well-funded competitor to replicate this attribute?
- Less than 6 months: Fragile advantage — not reliable for positioning
- 6-18 months: Moderate advantage — position on it but watch for competitor moves
- 18+ months or structural: Strong advantage — this is a durable differentiator

### Technique 4: The Sales Test
Ask your sales team: "When we win deals, what specific capabilities do customers cite?" and "When we lose, what do they say we're missing?" The attributes that show up in wins but not losses are your strongest differentiators.

## Maintaining Your Attribute Inventory

Unique attributes are not static. Competitors evolve, markets shift, and your own product changes. Maintain a living attribute inventory:

### Quarterly Review Checklist

- [ ] Review each unique attribute against latest competitor offerings
- [ ] Remove attributes that competitors have replicated
- [ ] Add new attributes from recent product releases
- [ ] Update evidence for each attribute
- [ ] Check that attribute clusters still make sense
- [ ] Verify that the priority ranking still reflects customer feedback
- [ ] Flag any attributes that are becoming fragile (competitors closing the gap)

### Triggers for Ad-Hoc Review

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Major competitor product launch | Verify all attributes still pass the uniqueness test |
| Significant win rate change | Investigate whether attribute relevance has shifted |
| New product release | Add new potential attributes and verify uniqueness |
| Customer segment expansion | Check if attributes are valued by the new segment |
| Acquisition of or by a competitor | Reassess competitive landscape and attribute uniqueness |

## Common Mistakes in Attribute Identification

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Claiming subjective attributes | "Best user experience" | Quantify: "Users complete onboarding in 4 minutes vs. industry average of 45" |
| Confusing features with attributes | "We have reporting" | Push deeper: "What about our reporting is unique?" |
| Listing internal capabilities customers can't see | "We use Kubernetes" | Translate to customer-facing attributes: "99.99% uptime guaranteed by auto-scaling architecture" |
| Including planned but not-yet-shipped attributes | "We're building AI-powered X" | Only include what exists today. Mark planned attributes separately. |
| Over-claiming uniqueness | "We're the only ones who care about customers" | Apply the uniqueness test rigorously. Ask: "Can a competitor say this too?" |
| Having too many attributes | A list of 30 "unique" things | Cluster and prioritize. Focus on the 8-12 strongest, grouped into 3-4 themes. |

## Exercise: Attribute Strength Assessment

For each of your unique attributes, score them on the following dimensions (1-5 scale):

| Attribute | Uniqueness (1-5) | Customer Value (1-5) | Defensibility (1-5) | Provability (1-5) | Total |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------|
| [Attribute 1] | | | | | /20 |
| [Attribute 2] | | | | | /20 |
| [Attribute 3] | | | | | /20 |

**Scoring guide:**
- **Uniqueness:** 1 = several competitors have this, 5 = absolutely no one else has this
- **Customer Value:** 1 = nice to have, 5 = customers cite this as primary purchase reason
- **Defensibility:** 1 = competitors could replicate in weeks, 5 = structural advantage that would take years to replicate
- **Provability:** 1 = subjective claim, 5 = backed by hard data, certifications, or customer testimonials

Attributes scoring 16+ are your positioning pillars. Attributes scoring 8-15 are supporting evidence. Attributes scoring below 8 should be deprioritized or removed from your positioning.
