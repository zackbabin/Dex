# Team Positioning Exercise — Facilitator Guide

Positioning is a team sport. The most brilliant positioning in the world fails if the team isn't aligned on it. This guide provides everything a facilitator needs to run a cross-functional positioning exercise that produces a complete, team-aligned positioning canvas. The exercise follows April Dunford's 5-step process and typically takes 2.5-3 hours with proper preparation.

## Why a Team Exercise

Individual positioning work produces individual opinions. Team positioning exercises produce:

- **Shared understanding** of competitive alternatives, unique attributes, and customer value
- **Cross-functional buy-in** from product, sales, marketing, and leadership
- **Diverse perspectives** — sales knows what competitors say, product knows technical uniqueness, CS knows what customers value most
- **Commitment to the output** — people support what they help create
- **A single source of truth** that everyone references

## Pre-Workshop Preparation (1-2 Weeks Before)

### Facilitator Preparation

| Task | Timeline | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| Schedule the session | 2 weeks before | Block 3 hours. Protect from interruptions. No "hard stops at 2 hours." |
| Select participants | 2 weeks before | 5-8 people ideal. Must include: founder/CEO, head of product, senior sales rep, head of marketing, customer success lead. |
| Conduct customer interviews | 2 weeks before | Interview 10-15 happy customers about alternatives, value, and how they describe the product. |
| Compile competitive intelligence | 1 week before | Gather competitor websites, feature matrices, pricing, positioning statements. |
| Gather win/loss data | 1 week before | Summarize last 20 won deals and last 20 lost deals. What alternatives were considered? Why did you win/lose? |
| Prepare materials | 3 days before | Print blank positioning canvas for each participant. Prepare whiteboard/digital board. Sticky notes, markers. |
| Send pre-read | 3 days before | Share: customer interview summary, win/loss summary, competitive overview. Ask participants to read before attending. |
| Assign pre-work | 3 days before | Each participant answers: (1) What would customers use if we didn't exist? (2) What do we do that no one else does? (3) Who is our ideal customer? |

### Pre-Read Package Contents

1. **Customer interview summary** (2-3 pages): Key quotes organized by theme. What alternatives customers mentioned. How customers describe the product's value.
2. **Win/loss summary** (1-2 pages): Top reasons for wins. Top reasons for losses. Most common competitive alternatives encountered.
3. **Competitive overview** (2-3 pages): Feature comparison matrix. Competitor positioning statements. Competitor pricing.
4. **Current positioning** (1 page): Current website headline, boilerplate, sales pitch opening. This is the baseline you're evaluating.

## Workshop Agenda — Minute by Minute

### Opening (15 minutes) — 0:00-0:15

**0:00-0:05 — Set the stage**
- Welcome and logistics (breaks, timing, ground rules)
- "Today we're going to align on how we position our product. Positioning is not messaging — it's the strategic foundation that messaging is built on."
- Ground rules:
  - Every opinion must be backed by evidence (customer data, win/loss data, or direct experience)
  - We're seeking consensus, not unanimity — majority rules on close calls
  - Defer to customer evidence over personal opinion
  - No devices unless referencing data
  - What's said in this room stays in this room (creates psychological safety)

**0:05-0:15 — Review the framework**
- Walk through the 5 steps briefly (1-2 minutes per step)
- Explain that each step builds on the previous one
- Show the blank positioning canvas — "This is what we'll fill in together by the end"

### Step 1: Competitive Alternatives (30 minutes) — 0:15-0:45

**0:15-0:25 — Individual brainstorm (10 min)**
- Each person writes competitive alternatives on sticky notes (one per note)
- Prompt: "If our product disappeared tomorrow, what would our best customers use or do instead?"
- Remind: Include spreadsheets, manual processes, hiring someone, and doing nothing

**0:25-0:35 — Share and cluster (10 min)**
- Go around the room. Each person places stickies on the board and explains.
- Facilitator groups similar alternatives together.
- Label each cluster.

**0:35-0:45 — Validate and rank (10 min)**
- Cross-reference with customer interview data. Remove alternatives without customer evidence.
- Dot-vote: Each person gets 3 dots. Place on the alternatives that are MOST commonly considered by best-fit customers.
- Record the top 3-5 competitive alternatives.

**Facilitator notes:**
- Sales team members often have the strongest input here — they hear competitor names daily
- If the group can't agree, defer to customer data
- Common debate: whether "do nothing" is a real alternative. If more than 30% of deals end in no decision, it is.

### Step 2: Unique Attributes (30 minutes) — 0:45-1:15

**0:45-0:55 — Individual brainstorm (10 min)**
- Each person writes unique attributes on sticky notes
- Prompt: "What do we have or do that NONE of the competitive alternatives we just listed can claim?"
- Remind: Consider features, architecture, data, team, business model, methodology

**0:55-1:05 — Share and verify (10 min)**
- Go around the room. Each person shares attributes.
- For EACH attribute, the group asks: "Can [alternative A] claim this? What about [alternative B]?"
- If ANY alternative can make the claim, it's not unique — move to a "table stakes" pile
- Only verified unique attributes stay

**1:05-1:15 — Cluster and record (10 min)**
- Group related unique attributes into clusters (these will become value themes)
- Name each cluster
- Record all unique attributes organized by cluster

**Facilitator notes:**
- Product and engineering team members are strongest here
- The most common mistake is claiming "better" versions of common features as unique. Push back: "Is this UNIQUE or just BETTER?"
- If the team struggles to find unique attributes, that's a critical finding — you may have a differentiation problem

### Break (10 minutes) — 1:15-1:25

### Step 3: Value Mapping (25 minutes) — 1:25-1:50

**1:25-1:35 — "So what?" chains (10 min)**
- For each attribute cluster, run the "So what?" chain as a group
- Facilitator writes on the board: Attribute → "So what?" → Advantage → "So what?" → Value
- Keep going until you reach something a customer would care about
- Stop when the value is specific and measurable (not generic like "save time")

**1:35-1:45 — Name value themes (10 min)**
- For each cluster, agree on a value theme name that captures the benefit
- Write a one-sentence value statement for each theme
- Identify the primary proof point for each theme

**1:45-1:50 — Rank value themes (5 min)**
- Which theme matters MOST to best-fit customers?
- Rank: primary, secondary, tertiary
- This hierarchy will drive messaging priority

**Facilitator notes:**
- Customer success and sales team members are strongest here — they hear how customers describe value
- If the "So what?" chain goes more than 4 levels, the attribute may not connect strongly to customer value
- Keep asking: "Would a customer actually say this? Would they use these words?"

### Step 4: Best-Fit Customers (20 minutes) — 1:50-2:10

**1:50-2:00 — Characteristics brainstorm (10 min)**
- "Who cares THE MOST about the value themes we just identified?"
- Each person lists characteristics of their best customers
- Focus on ACTIONABLE characteristics (things you can identify before talking to them)
- Prompt with categories: industry, size, role, tech stack, trigger event

**2:00-2:10 — Agree on definition (10 min)**
- Look for characteristics that appear across multiple people's lists
- Write the best-fit customer definition: "[Role] at [company type] that [characteristics] experiencing [trigger]"
- Validate: "Can we build a target list of 100+ accounts from this definition?"
- Validate: "Do our best existing customers match this definition?"

**Facilitator notes:**
- The biggest debate is usually around how narrow to go. Push for tighter: "Are we defining who we're BEST for, or who we could POSSIBLY sell to?"
- If sales pushes back on narrowing, remind them: "This is about who we POSITION for, not who we'll refuse to sell to"
- Ensure the definition uses actionable criteria, not psychographics

### Step 5: Market Category (25 minutes) — 2:10-2:35

**2:10-2:20 — Evaluate options (10 min)**
- Present the three strategies: head-to-head, subcategory, new category
- For each, ask: "If we positioned in [category], what would customers expect? What would they compare us to?"
- List pros and cons of each option for your specific situation

**2:20-2:30 — Debate and decide (10 min)**
- The key question: "In which category does our unique value seem MOST obvious?"
- Test: "If a prospect heard we were a [category], would they immediately understand why our unique attributes matter?"
- Vote if needed. Majority rules.

**2:30-2:35 — Identify relevant trends (5 min)**
- "What market trends make our positioning feel timely and urgent?"
- List 1-3 trends that genuinely connect to your unique value
- Remove any trend that doesn't directly relate to your positioning

**Facilitator notes:**
- This is often the most contentious step. Founders may want a new category (vision). Sales may want an existing category (easier to sell). Marketing may want a subcategory (easier to differentiate).
- Defer to: "What do our best customers call us?" and "What category would make our value most obvious to a new prospect?"

### Synthesis (20 minutes) — 2:35-2:55

**2:35-2:45 — Complete the positioning canvas (10 min)**
- Fill in all components on the positioning canvas together
- Read it aloud as a group — does it feel right? Is anything missing or contradictory?

**2:45-2:50 — Write the positioning statement (5 min)**
- Template: "For [best-fit customers], [product] is the [category] that [primary value], unlike [key alternative] which [limitation]."
- Wordsmith as a group. Keep it under 2 sentences.

**2:50-2:55 — Draft the primary message (5 min)**
- Write one headline that captures the essence of the positioning
- This is the external expression of the positioning statement
- Test: "Would this headline make a best-fit prospect stop scrolling?"

### Closing (10 minutes) — 2:55-3:05

**2:55-3:00 — Review and commit**
- Read the complete positioning canvas aloud
- Ask: "Can everyone in this room commit to using this positioning?"
- Note any reservations — these become follow-up items

**3:00-3:05 — Assign follow-up actions**
- Assign owner and deadline for each follow-up item (see below)
- Schedule 90-day positioning review

## Handling Disagreements

### Common Disagreements and Resolution Approaches

| Disagreement | Resolution |
|-------------|------------|
| Founder wants broad positioning; sales wants narrow | Remind the founder: positioning for best-fit doesn't limit who you sell to. It sharpens the wedge. |
| Team can't agree on competitive alternatives | Default to customer data. If no data, this is a sign you need more customer interviews before positioning. |
| Debate about whether an attribute is "unique" | If there's genuine debate, it's probably not unique enough. Err on the side of removing it. |
| Marketing wants aspirational positioning; sales wants practical | Positioning must be true today. Marketing can push messaging toward aspiration, but the positioning itself must be grounded in current reality. |
| No one can agree on market category | Test multiple category framings with 5-10 prospects. Let the market decide. |

### The "Disagree and Commit" Protocol

If consensus can't be reached on a component after 15 minutes of discussion:
1. Acknowledge the disagreement explicitly
2. Vote — majority wins
3. Set a 90-day review point to revisit with data
4. Everyone commits to the decision for 90 days

## Remote Workshop Adaptations

| In-Person Element | Remote Adaptation |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sticky notes on whiteboard | Miro, FigJam, or MURAL board with pre-created sections |
| Dot voting | Built-in voting feature in digital whiteboard tools |
| Side conversations | Breakout rooms for 5-minute pair discussions before group share |
| Reading body language | Explicit check-ins: "Thumbs up/down — do we have consensus?" |
| Energy management | Shorten to 2.5 hours. Add a second 10-minute break. Use more structured turn-taking. |
| Pre-work | Even MORE important remotely. Send materials 5 days before, not 3. |
| Facilitation | Co-facilitator to manage chat, handle tech issues, and watch for raised hands |

### Remote-Specific Tips
- Camera on for everyone, no exceptions
- One person speaks at a time (use a virtual "talking stick" — whoever has it speaks)
- Use the chat for "+1" reactions, not for side conversations
- Record the session (with permission) for anyone who needs to reference it
- Have a dedicated note-taker who isn't the facilitator

### The 90-Day Review

At the 90-day mark, reconvene the group (60 minutes) to assess:

- [ ] Is the team consistently using the positioning?
- [ ] Are prospects understanding the positioning in sales conversations?
- [ ] Have win rates changed since implementing the positioning?
- [ ] Has any competitive alternative shifted that would change the positioning?
- [ ] Does the positioning still feel accurate and compelling?
- [ ] What's working well? What needs adjustment?
