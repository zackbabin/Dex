# Negotiation

Tactical empathy-based negotiation framework from FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss. Transform any negotiation by understanding the emotional drivers behind decisions and using proven techniques to build rapport, uncover hidden information, and reach better outcomes.

## Core Principle

**People want to be understood and feel safe.** Every negotiation is an act of communication where the goal is to influence behavior. The most effective path to "yes" runs through empathy, active listening, and emotional intelligence -- not logic, arguments, or compromise.

**The foundation:** Treat every negotiation as a discovery process. Your assumptions are hypotheses to be tested, not truths to be defended. Focus on the other side's needs (respect, security, autonomy) rather than their stated positions. Never split the difference -- no deal is better than a bad deal.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or preparing negotiations, rate them 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full tactical empathy engagement, calibrated questions prepared, accusation audit delivered, emotions labeled, "That's right" achieved, and Black Swans actively hunted; lower scores indicate missed opportunities for rapport, information gathering, or deal improvement. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## Framework

### 1. Tactical Empathy

**Core concept:** Consciously imagine yourself in the counterpart's situation, then vocalize their perspective to create trust and openness.

**Why it works:** When people feel understood, brain chemistry shifts toward trust and cooperation. Empathy short-circuits defensive reactions and opens the door to genuine dialogue. It is not agreement -- you can understand their position while advocating for your own.

**Key insights:**
- Before responding, ask: "What is their world like right now?"
- Articulate their situation, pressures, and fears before stating your position
- Empathy must be genuine, not performed -- people detect fakeness instantly
- Combine with mirroring and labeling for maximum effect
- Unconditional positive regard: respect them as a person regardless of disagreement
- Stay calm and positive -- emotions are contagious; slow pace enables clear thinking

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Customer support** | Acknowledge frustration before offering solutions | "I understand this outage is affecting your team's ability to deliver on deadline" |
| **Sales calls** | Demonstrate understanding of prospect's challenges | "It sounds like you're under pressure to show results this quarter" |
| **Pricing conversations** | Acknowledge budget constraints upfront | "I know that adding another tool to the stack feels risky right now" |
| **Partnership negotiations** | Show understanding of partner's internal pressures | "Your team probably needs to justify this to leadership" |
| **Contract renewals** | Recognize changing needs | "It seems like your priorities have shifted since we last spoke" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "I understand you're dealing with..."
- "It seems like this is creating pressure for your team..."
- "I can see why this feels risky..."
- "Before we talk about next steps, I want to make sure I understand where you're coming from..."

**Ethical boundary:** Use empathy to genuinely understand, not to manipulate emotions. Tactical empathy builds real relationships, not exploitative ones.

### 2. Mirroring

**Core concept:** Repeat the last 1-3 critical words your counterpart said, using a curious, upward-inflecting tone, then go silent.

**Why it works:** Mirroring creates familiarity and rapport by signaling deep listening. It prompts elaboration without direct questions, making people feel heard while revealing more information than they intended to share.

**Key insights:**
- Listen for the key phrase or emotion-laden words
- Repeat them back as a gentle question with upward inflection
- Wait silently (4+ seconds) for them to expand
- Works in person, on phone, and in written communication
- Combines powerfully with labeling and tactical silence
- The simplest technique but often the most effective for information gathering

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Discovery calls** | Mirror key concerns to get elaboration | Client: "The timeline is tight." You: "The timeline is tight?" |
| **User interviews** | Encourage deeper explanation of pain points | User: "It's just frustrating." You: "Frustrating?" |
| **Objection handling** | Reflect objection to understand root cause | "Doesn't fit your budget?" |
| **Negotiation emails** | Mirror key phrases in written responses | "You mentioned the partnership 'doesn't make sense'..." |
| **Feedback sessions** | Encourage elaboration on vague feedback | "Not quite what you expected?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "[Key phrase they used]?" (with question mark)
- "You mentioned [their exact words]..."
- "When you say [mirror], what does that look like?"
- "Not quite right?" (after they hesitate)

**Ethical boundary:** Mirror to understand, not to manipulate people into revealing information they want to keep private.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

### 3. Labeling

**Core concept:** Identify and verbalize the counterpart's emotions or perspective using neutral phrases: "It seems like...", "It sounds like...", "It looks like..."

**Why it works:** Naming emotions validates them and diffuses their power. Labeling negative emotions reduces their intensity; labeling positive emotions reinforces them. The tentative phrasing ("It seems like...") gives them room to correct you, which deepens the conversation either way.

**Key insights:**
- Always use third-person phrasing ("It seems like..."), never "I think you..."
- After labeling, be silent -- let them respond
- Labeling negative emotions diffuses them; labeling positive emotions amplifies them
- If your label is wrong, they'll correct you -- which is still valuable information
- Combine labels with tactical silence for maximum effect
- Watch for emotional shifts that signal you've hit the mark

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Customer complaints** | Name the frustration before solving | "It sounds like you feel let down by our response time" |
| **Sales objections** | Label the underlying concern | "It seems like there's a concern about implementation risk" |
| **Team conflicts** | Surface unspoken tensions | "It looks like there's frustration about how decisions are being made" |
| **Pricing pushback** | Acknowledge the emotional reaction | "It seems like the price feels disconnected from the value you've seen so far" |
| **Churn prevention** | Identify the real reason for leaving | "It sounds like something changed since you first signed up" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "It seems like..."
- "It sounds like you're feeling..."
- "It looks like this is creating..."
- "If I'm reading this right, it feels like..."

**Ethical boundary:** Label emotions to show understanding, not to weaponize someone's feelings against them.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

### 4. Calibrated Questions

**Core concept:** Open-ended "How...?" and "What...?" questions that shape the conversation while giving the counterpart the illusion of control.

**Why it works:** Calibrated questions engage the counterpart's problem-solving mind, making them feel in charge while you steer the dialogue. They avoid defensiveness that "Why?" creates (which sounds accusatory) and force the other side to consider your position without you stating it directly.

**Key insights:**
- Start with "How" or "What" -- avoid "Why" (sounds accusatory)
- "How am I supposed to do that?" is the most powerful pushback without saying no
- Questions should be genuinely collaborative, not sarcastic
- Use to uncover hidden constraints, needs, and decision-making processes
- Exception for "Why": use only when you want them to defend something favorable to you ("Why would you ever choose our company?")
- Follow every "yes" with "How...?" to ensure implementation commitment

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Price negotiation** | Push back without refusing | "How am I supposed to do that at that price point?" |
| **Scope creep** | Make them own the constraint | "What happens to the timeline if we add this?" |
| **Stakeholder alignment** | Uncover hidden decision-makers | "How does your team typically make decisions like this?" |
| **Contract terms** | Surface implementation concerns | "What does the approval process look like on your end?" |
| **Feature requests** | Redirect to real needs | "What's the biggest challenge you're trying to solve?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "How am I supposed to do that?"
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?"
- "How can we make this work for both of us?"
- "What would it take to make this happen?"
- "How does this affect your team?"

**Ethical boundary:** Use calibrated questions to create genuine collaboration, not to trap people into commitments they don't want to make.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

### 5. Accusation Audit

**Core concept:** Before negotiating, list and preemptively verbalize every negative thing the counterpart might think or say about you.

**Why it works:** Naming fears and criticisms before the other side does removes their power. It often triggers reassurance ("Oh, I don't think that...") or at minimum neutralizes objections. By addressing elephants in the room first, you demonstrate self-awareness and build trust.

**Key insights:**
- Brainstorm every negative they might think about you or your position before the meeting
- Deliver the audit early in the conversation, not after they've raised objections
- The list should feel slightly worse than what they actually think -- it overshoots on purpose
- Watch them relax as you address concerns they hadn't even voiced
- Particularly powerful when you're the party with less leverage
- Combine with tactical empathy for maximum disarming effect

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Price increase announcement** | Preempt anger before explaining | "You're probably thinking we don't value your loyalty..." |
| **Sales cold outreach** | Acknowledge the intrusion | "I know you're busy and the last thing you want is another sales pitch..." |
| **Difficult product feedback** | Disarm defensiveness | "You might think we haven't been listening to your feedback..." |
| **Contract renegotiation** | Address power imbalance | "You probably feel like we're trying to squeeze more out of this..." |
| **Service failure recovery** | Own the failure fully | "You're probably furious, and you have every right to be..." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "You probably think..."
- "You may feel like..."
- "I know this might seem like..."
- "You might be wondering why you should even listen to..."

**Ethical boundary:** Use accusation audits to build trust through transparency, not to preemptively shut down legitimate concerns.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

### 6. "That's Right"

**Core concept:** Summarize the counterpart's position -- facts, emotions, and concerns -- so accurately that they respond with "That's right." This is the breakthrough moment in any negotiation.

**Why it works:** "That's right" signals that the person feels completely understood. It creates genuine rapport and shifts their mindset from adversarial to collaborative. It is fundamentally different from "You're right" (which often means they're dismissing you).

**Key insights:**
- "That's right" is the two most powerful words in negotiation
- "You're right" is dangerous -- it usually means "go away, I don't want to talk anymore"
- Listen deeply throughout the conversation before attempting a summary
- Include emotional subtext in your summary, not just facts
- If you get "You're right" instead, keep working -- you haven't truly connected yet
- Use the Rule of Three: confirm agreement 3 times in 3 different ways to ensure commitment
- Apply the "No" technique first -- let them say "No" to feel safe, then work toward "That's right"

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sales closing** | Summarize their needs before proposing | "So your team needs X, you're worried about Y, and Z is the deal-breaker..." |
| **Customer retention** | Show you understand why they're leaving | "Let me make sure I have this: the product isn't delivering on the promise we made..." |
| **Stakeholder buy-in** | Summarize concerns before pitching | "What I'm hearing is that the risk feels too high given the current roadmap..." |
| **Team alignment** | Validate before redirecting | "So the concern is that this initiative will stretch the team too thin..." |
| **Negotiation closure** | Confirm understanding before terms | "Let me make sure I understand: you need [X], by [date], and [constraint]..." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Let me make sure I understand..."
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "If I'm hearing you correctly..."
- "It sounds like [complete summary of their position including emotions]..."

**Ethical boundary:** Seek "That's right" through genuine understanding, not through manipulative reframing of their position.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

### 7. Ackerman Bargaining

**Core concept:** A systematic monetary negotiation method using calculated offers in decreasing increments (65% -> 85% -> 95% -> 100%) with precise non-round numbers and a non-monetary bonus at the end.

**Why it works:** Decreasing increments signal that you're approaching your limit. Precise, non-round numbers ($47,235 vs $47,000) feel calculated and final -- as if you've truly pushed to your absolute maximum. The final non-monetary gift signals generosity at the limit, making it psychologically harder for them to ask for more.

**Key insights:**
- Set your target price first (what you actually want to pay/receive)
- Open at 65% of target to create room for concessions
- Raise in decreasing increments: 85% -> 95% -> 100%
- Use precise, non-round numbers on final offer ($10,230 not $10,000)
- Include a non-monetary bonus with final offer ("...and I'll include X")
- Never make concessions without getting something in return
- If they anchor with an extreme number, don't counter -- use calibrated questions: "How did you arrive at that figure?"

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Salary negotiation** | Structure counter-offers systematically | Target $120K: open discussion at $78K, move to $102K, $114K, final $120,350 + extra PTO |
| **Vendor pricing** | Methodical price reduction | Target $50K: start at $32.5K, move to $42.5K, $47.5K, final $49,850 + extended payment terms |
| **Contract value** | Anchor and increment strategically | Set target, open low, concede in shrinking amounts with precise figures |
| **SaaS enterprise deals** | Multi-year pricing negotiations | Use decreasing discount increments across contract years |
| **Freelance rates** | Project-based negotiation | Anchor with lower scope, expand incrementally with precise totals |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Based on our analysis, we can offer $[precise number]..."
- "We've stretched as far as we can -- $[precise number], and we'll include [non-monetary bonus]"
- "I've gone back to my team and the absolute best we can do is $[precise number]"
- "To make this work, how about $[precise number] with [non-monetary addition]?"

**Ethical boundary:** Use the Ackerman method for fair negotiations, not to lowball or exploit people who lack negotiation skills.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

### 8. Black Swans

**Core concept:** Hidden, game-changing pieces of information that can transform a negotiation once discovered. Every negotiation has approximately three Black Swans lurking.

**Why it works:** Negotiations stall or fail when critical information remains hidden. Black Swans are the unknown unknowns -- secret constraints, hidden motivations, or unknown context -- that explain seemingly irrational behavior. Discovering even one can turn a stalemate into a breakthrough.

**Key insights:**
- Every negotiation has approximately 3 Black Swans lurking
- Types: secret constraints (boss said no more than X), hidden motivations (need this deal to save their job), unknown context (competitor just made a move)
- Stay curious; ask calibrated questions to surface them
- Watch for anomalies -- odd reactions, hesitations, or inconsistencies signal hidden factors
- Listen in unguarded moments (before/after meetings, casual conversation)
- If they seem irrational, diagnose: are they (1) ill-informed, (2) constrained, or (3) hiding something?
- Use three types of leverage -- positive (what they want), negative (what they fear), and normative (their own stated values) -- to surface hidden information

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Enterprise sales** | Discover hidden budget or timeline constraints | "What happens internally if this doesn't get resolved by Q3?" |
| **Churn analysis** | Uncover the real reason behind cancellation | "It seems like something changed -- what happened?" |
| **Partnership deals** | Surface unstated strategic motivations | "How does this fit into your bigger picture for next year?" |
| **Hiring negotiations** | Discover candidate's true priorities | "What would make you regret not taking this offer?" |
| **Competitive situations** | Reveal information about competing offers | "It sounds like you're weighing other options -- what would help you decide?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "What's the biggest thing I'm missing here?"
- "What would change everything about this situation?"
- "Help me understand -- what's really driving this?"
- "If there's something I should know that would make this work better for both of us..."

**Ethical boundary:** Hunt for Black Swans to create better outcomes for both sides, not to exploit private or sensitive information.

See: [references/techniques.md](references/techniques.md)

## Handling Common Situations

**They say "That's not fair":**
- Stop immediately: "I want to be fair. Have I done something unfair? Let's discuss it."

**They anchor with an extreme number:**
- Don't counter immediately; use calibrated questions: "How did you arrive at that figure?"

**They stop responding:**
- Send: "Have you given up on [the project]?" -- triggers "No" response

**They seem irrational:**
- Diagnose: Are they (1) ill-informed, (2) constrained, or (3) hiding something?
- Use calibrated questions to uncover which

## Counterpart Styles

Adapt your approach based on their negotiation style:

| Style | Signs | Adapt by... |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Analyst** | Methodical, data-driven, hates surprises | Use facts, be patient, don't rush |
| **Accommodator** | Friendly, relationship-focused, avoids conflict | Build rapport, but pin down specifics |
| **Assertive** | Direct, time-conscious, wants to win | Be efficient, stand firm, acknowledge their points |

**Insight:** Great negotiators borrow from all three styles as needed.

## Voice and Delivery

- **Default voice**: Positive, warm, light-hearted (with a smile)
- **Critical moments**: Late-Night DJ Voice -- slow, calm, downward inflection
- **After key statements**: Pause 4+ seconds (tactical silence)
- **Watch their nonverbals**: 7% words, 38% tone, 55% body language

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Splitting the difference** | Creates lukewarm outcomes nobody is happy with | Hold firm; no deal is better than a bad deal |
| **Pushing for "yes"** | Makes people defensive and produces counterfeit agreement | Pursue "That's right" instead; let them say "No" first |
| **Arguing your position** | Triggers resistance and shuts down listening | Use calibrated questions and labels to let them talk |
| **Skipping the accusation audit** | Unaddressed objections fester and derail later | List every negative they might think; address them early |
| **Countering an extreme anchor immediately** | Validates their anchor as the starting point | Mirror, label, ask "How did you arrive at that?" |
| **Using "Why?"** | Sounds accusatory and triggers defensiveness | Replace with "What" and "How" questions |
| **Treating "You're right" as success** | It means they want you to go away, not that they agree | Keep working toward "That's right" |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any negotiation preparation or live interaction:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Have I prepared an accusation audit? | Objections will blindside you | List every negative they might think; address early |
| Do I have 3-5 calibrated questions ready? | You'll default to arguing | Draft "How" and "What" questions targeting their needs |
| Have I identified my BATNA? | You'll accept a bad deal under pressure | Define your walk-away point before negotiating |
| Am I aiming for "That's right"? | You'll chase counterfeit "yes" | Summarize their position until they affirm genuinely |
| Have I considered their negotiation style? | One-size-fits-all approach will misfire | Assess if they're Analyst, Accommodator, or Assertive |
| Am I hunting for Black Swans? | You'll miss game-changing information | Stay curious; watch for anomalies; ask about the unexpected |
