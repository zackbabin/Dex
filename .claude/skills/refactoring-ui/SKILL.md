# Refactoring UI Design System

A practical, opinionated approach to UI design. Apply these principles when generating frontend code, reviewing designs, or advising on visual improvements.

## Core Principle

**Design in grayscale first. Add color last.** This forces proper hierarchy through spacing, contrast, and typography before relying on color as a crutch.

**The foundation:** Great UI isn't about creativity or talent -- it's about systems. Constrained scales for spacing, type, color, and shadows produce consistently professional results. Start with too much white space, then remove. Details come later -- don't obsess over icons, shadows, or micro-interactions until the layout and hierarchy work.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating UI designs or frontend code, rate it 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full alignment with all guidelines; lower scores indicate gaps to address. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The Refactoring UI Framework

Seven principles for building professional interfaces without a designer:

### 1. Visual Hierarchy

**Core concept:** Not everything can be important. Create hierarchy through three levers: size, weight, and color.

**Why it works:** When every element competes for attention, nothing stands out. Deliberate de-emphasis of secondary content makes primary content powerful by contrast.

**Key insights:**
- Combine levers, don't multiply -- primary text = large OR bold OR dark, not all three
- Save "all three" for the single most important element on the page
- Labels are secondary -- form labels, table headers, and metadata labels support the data, not compete with it
- Semantic color does not equal visual weight -- a muted red secondary button often works better than screaming danger for routine actions
- De-emphasize labels by making them smaller, lighter, or uppercase-small

**Product applications:**

| Context | Hierarchy Technique | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Form fields** | De-emphasize labels, emphasize values | Small uppercase label above large value text |
| **Navigation** | Primary nav bold, secondary nav lighter | Active link in dark gray-900, inactive in gray-500 |
| **Cards** | Title large, metadata small and light | Card title 20px bold, date 12px gray-400 |
| **Dashboards** | Key metric large, context small | Revenue "$42,300" large, "vs last month" small |
| **Tables** | De-emphasize headers, emphasize cell data | Headers uppercase small gray, data normal weight |

**Design patterns:**
- Three-level hierarchy table: Size (large/base/small), Weight (bold/medium/normal), Color (dark/medium/light gray)
- Label-value pattern: de-emphasized label above emphasized value
- Button hierarchy: primary (filled), secondary (outlined or muted), tertiary (text only)

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use hierarchy tricks to hide important information like pricing, terms, or cancellation options.

See: [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for interaction states and advanced component patterns.

### 2. Spacing & Sizing

**Core concept:** Use a constrained spacing scale, not arbitrary values. Spacing defines relationships -- elements closer together are more related.

**Why it works:** Arbitrary spacing (padding: 13px) creates inconsistency. A fixed scale forces deliberate decisions and produces harmonious layouts. Generous spacing feels premium; dense spacing feels overwhelming.

**Key insights:**
- Use a linear or near-linear scale: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px
- Start with too much white space, then remove -- you'll almost never remove enough
- Spacing between groups should be larger than spacing within groups
- Text blocks should be constrained to 45-75 characters (`max-w-prose` or ~65ch)
- Forms should max out at 300-500px width
- Full-width is almost never right for content

**Product applications:**

| Context | Spacing Strategy | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Icon + label** | Tight coupling (4px) | Small gap keeps them visually connected |
| **Form fields** | Related elements (8-16px) | Input and its label tightly coupled |
| **Card sections** | Section separation (24px) | Title block, content block, footer block |
| **Page sections** | Major sections (48-64px) | Hero, features, testimonials, footer |
| **Container width** | Constrain to content | `max-w-prose` for text, `max-w-md` for forms |

**CSS patterns:**
- `p-1`(4px) `p-2`(8px) `p-4`(16px) `p-6`(24px) `p-8`(32px) `p-12`(48px) `p-16`(64px)
- `max-w-prose`(65ch) `max-w-md`(28rem) `max-w-lg`(32rem) `max-w-xl`(36rem)
- `gap-2` for related items, `gap-6` for section separation

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use spacing to bury important UI elements like unsubscribe buttons or privacy controls.

See: [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for responsive breakpoint strategies.

### 3. Typography

**Core concept:** Use a modular type scale, constrain line heights by context, and limit to two font families maximum.

**Why it works:** A modular scale (e.g., 1.25 ratio) creates natural visual rhythm. Tight line heights on headings and relaxed line heights on body text improve readability across contexts.

**Key insights:**
- Use a modular scale: 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36px (1.25 ratio)
- Headings need tight line height (1.0-1.25); body text needs relaxed (1.5-1.75)
- Wider text needs more line height
- Avoid font weights below 400 for body text -- they become unreadable
- Use bold (600-700) for emphasis, not for everything
- Two fonts maximum: one for headings, one for body (or one family with weight variation)

**Product applications:**

| Context | Typography Rule | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Hero headline** | 36px, tight line-height (1.1), bold | Large impactful statement |
| **Section title** | 24px, line-height 1.25, semibold | Clear section demarcation |
| **Body text** | 16px, line-height 1.75, normal weight | Comfortable reading |
| **Captions/labels** | 12-14px, line-height 1.5, medium gray | Secondary information |
| **Code/data** | Monospace, 14px, consistent width | Tabular data alignment |

**CSS patterns:**
- `text-xs`(12px) `text-sm`(14px) `text-base`(16px) `text-lg`(18px) `text-xl`(20px)
- `font-normal`(400) `font-medium`(500) `font-semibold`(600) `font-bold`(700)
- `leading-tight`(1.25) `leading-normal`(1.5) `leading-relaxed`(1.75)

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use tiny type sizes to hide terms, conditions, or fees from users.

See: [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for text truncation and responsive typography.

### 4. Color

**Core concept:** Build a systematic palette with 5-9 shades per color, add subtle saturation to grays, and design in grayscale first.

**Why it works:** Random colors clash. A systematic palette with predefined shades ensures consistency across the entire interface. HSL adjustments create natural-feeling lighter and darker variants.

**Key insights:**
- Each color needs 5-9 shades from near-white to near-black (50 through 900)
- The darkest shade is not black -- use 900-level dark grays (e.g., `#111827`) instead of pure `#000000`
- Pure grays look lifeless -- add subtle saturation (cool UI: blue tint like `#64748b`; warm UI: yellow/brown tint like `#78716c`)
- HSL adjustments: lighter = higher lightness, lower saturation, shift hue toward 60 degrees; darker = lower lightness, higher saturation, shift hue toward 0/240 degrees
- Body text minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio; large text (18px+) minimum 3:1
- Use `#374151` (gray-700) on white, not lighter grays for readable text

**Product applications:**

| Context | Color Strategy | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Primary palette** | 9 shades (50-900) for main brand color | Blue-500 for buttons, Blue-100 for backgrounds |
| **Gray palette** | Saturated grays matching UI temperature | Cool grays with blue tint for tech products |
| **Semantic colors** | Success, warning, error each with shade range | Green-500 for success, Red-500 for errors |
| **Text colors** | Three levels: dark, medium, light | `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600`, `text-gray-400` |
| **Accessible contrast** | Test all text/background combos | `#374151` on white = 10.5:1 ratio |

**CSS patterns:**
- `text-gray-900`(dark) `text-gray-600`(medium) `text-gray-400`(light)
- `bg-blue-50` for subtle backgrounds, `bg-blue-500` for primary actions
- `border-gray-200` for subtle borders, `border-gray-300` for stronger

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use color alone to convey information -- always pair with text or icons for accessibility.

See: [references/theming-dark-mode.md](references/theming-dark-mode.md) for dark palette creation and theme implementation.

### 5. Depth & Shadows

**Core concept:** Use a shadow scale to convey elevation. Small shadows for slightly raised elements, large shadows for floating elements.

**Why it works:** Shadows create a sense of physical depth that helps users understand which elements are interactive, which are floating above the surface, and which are part of the background.

**Key insights:**
- Small shadows = raised slightly (buttons, cards); large shadows = floating (modals, dropdowns)
- Shadows have two parts: a tight, dark shadow for crispness plus a larger, softer shadow for atmosphere
- Depth without shadows: lighter top border + darker bottom border, subtle gradient backgrounds, overlapping elements with offset
- Don't overuse shadows -- if everything floats, nothing has depth
- Shadow color should be transparent dark, not opaque gray

**Product applications:**

| Context | Shadow Level | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Buttons** | `shadow-sm` (subtle raise) | Slightly elevated above page surface |
| **Cards** | `shadow-md` (clear separation) | Content grouped and lifted from background |
| **Dropdowns** | `shadow-lg` (floating) | Menu clearly floating above content |
| **Modals** | `shadow-xl` (highest elevation) | Overlay clearly detached from page |
| **Flat alternatives** | Border + background shift | Lighter top border, darker bottom border |

**CSS patterns:**
- `shadow-sm`: `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`
- `shadow-md`: `0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
- `shadow-lg`: `0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
- `shadow-xl`: `0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use excessive shadows or visual emphasis to draw attention to deceptive UI elements (dark patterns).

See: [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for interaction states and elevation hierarchy.

### 6. Images & Icons

**Core concept:** Treat images as design elements, not afterthoughts. Size icons deliberately and use overlays to ensure text readability on images.

**Why it works:** Poorly sized icons look awkward. Unstyled images break visual consistency. Deliberate image treatment (overlays, object-fit, border radius) makes interfaces feel polished.

**Key insights:**
- Icons should be sized relative to their context -- don't use the same size everywhere
- Use icon sets with consistent stroke width and style
- Images need treatment: object-fit cover, consistent aspect ratios, overlays for text
- Don't stretch or distort images -- use `object-fit: cover` and crop deliberately
- Empty states are an opportunity -- use illustrations, not just text

**Product applications:**

| Context | Image/Icon Technique | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Hero images** | Overlay with semi-transparent gradient | Text readable over any photo |
| **Avatars** | Consistent size, rounded, fallback initials | 40px circle with object-fit cover |
| **Feature icons** | Consistent size, weight, and color | 24px stroke icons in gray-500 |
| **Empty states** | Custom illustration + clear CTA | Friendly illustration with "Get started" button |
| **Thumbnails** | Fixed aspect ratio with object-fit cover | 16:9 cards with no distortion |

**CSS patterns:**
- `object-fit: cover` with fixed `aspect-ratio` for consistent image display
- Icon sizing: `w-4 h-4` inline, `w-6 h-6` in navigation, `w-8 h-8` for feature icons
- Image overlay: `bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60 to-transparent` for text on images

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use misleading images or icons that misrepresent functionality or product capabilities.

See: [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for image treatment, icon usage, and empty states.

### 7. Layout & Composition

**Core concept:** Don't center everything. Use alignment, overlap, and emphasis variation to create engaging compositions.

**Why it works:** Left-aligned text is easier to read. Varied layouts keep users engaged. Breaking out of rigid boxes makes designs feel dynamic and intentional.

**Key insights:**
- Left-align text by default; center only short headlines, hero sections, single-action CTAs, and empty states
- Cards don't need to contain everything -- let images bleed to edges, overlap containers, or extend beyond bounds
- In lists and feeds, vary the visual treatment -- feature some items, minimize others
- Use alignment to create visual relationships between unrelated elements
- Alternate emphasis: not every card in a list needs the same layout

**Product applications:**

| Context | Layout Strategy | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Hero sections** | Centered text, generous spacing | Short headline + subtext + single CTA |
| **Feature grids** | Left-aligned text, consistent card sizes | 3-column grid with icon + title + description |
| **Blog feeds** | Varied card sizes for emphasis | First post large, next posts in 2-column grid |
| **Sidebars** | Narrower than main content, lighter background | Navigation or filters at 240-320px width |
| **Content pages** | Constrained width, left-aligned | `max-w-prose` centered container with left text |

**CSS patterns:**
- `text-left` by default, `text-center` only for heroes and short headlines
- `grid grid-cols-3 gap-6` for feature grids
- `max-w-4xl mx-auto` for page containers
- `overflow-hidden` on cards with `object-fit: cover` images that bleed to edges

**Ethical boundary:** Don't use layout tricks to hide or obscure important user choices like opt-outs or data permissions.

See: [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for responsive breakpoints and complex layout patterns.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **"Looks amateur"** | Insufficient white space, unconstrained widths | Add more white space, constrain content widths |
| **"Feels flat"** | No depth differentiation between elements | Add subtle shadows, border-bottom on sections |
| **"Text is hard to read"** | Poor line-height, too wide, low contrast | Increase line-height, constrain width, boost contrast |
| **"Everything looks the same"** | No visual hierarchy between elements | Vary size/weight/color between primary and secondary |
| **"Feels cluttered"** | Equal spacing everywhere, no grouping | Group related items, increase spacing between groups |
| **"Colors clash"** | Random color choices without a system | Reduce saturation, use more grays, limit palette to system |
| **"Buttons don't pop"** | Low contrast with surrounding elements | Increase contrast with surroundings, add shadow |
| **Using arbitrary values** | px values like 13, 17, 23 create inconsistency | Stick to the spacing and type scales |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any UI design:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Does hierarchy read when squinting (blur test)? | Elements competing for attention | Increase contrast between primary and secondary |
| Does it work in grayscale? | Relying on color for hierarchy | Strengthen size/weight/spacing hierarchy |
| Is there enough white space? | Probably not -- most designs are too dense | Increase spacing, especially between groups |
| Are labels de-emphasized vs. their values? | Labels competing with data | Make labels smaller, lighter, or uppercase-small |
| Does spacing follow a consistent scale? | Arbitrary spacing creates visual noise | Use 4/8/16/24/32/48/64 scale only |
| Is text width constrained for readability? | Long lines cause reader fatigue | Apply `max-w-prose` (~65ch) to text blocks |
| Do colors have sufficient contrast? | Accessibility failure, hard to read | Test with WCAG contrast checker, use gray-700+ on white |
| Are shadows appropriate for elevation? | Elements floating at wrong visual level | Match shadow scale to element purpose |
