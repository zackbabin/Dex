# Triggers in the Hook Model

Triggers are the actuators of behavior—the spark plugs of the Hook Model. Without a trigger, there is no action.

## External Triggers

External triggers are embedded with information that tells the user what to do next.

### Types of External Triggers

| Type | Definition | Example | Best For |
|------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Paid** | Advertising, SEM, affiliates | Google Ads, Facebook Ads | Acquisition |
| **Earned** | PR, viral content, app store features | Press coverage, viral posts | Growth spikes |
| **Relationship** | Word of mouth, referrals | "My friend told me about..." | Trust-based acquisition |
| **Owned** | Your own channels | Push notifications, emails, badges | Retention |

### External Trigger Design Principles

**1. Be specific about next action**
- Bad: "Check out our app"
- Good: "See 3 new matches" (specific action implied)

**2. Create urgency without manipulation**
- Bad: "Limited time only!" (generic)
- Good: "Your weekly report is ready" (time-relevant)

**3. Tie to internal trigger**
- Bad: "We miss you!" (your need, not theirs)
- Good: "5 friends posted while you were away" (FOMO trigger)

**4. Respect attention**
- Bad: Daily notifications for everything
- Good: Triggered by meaningful events

### Owned Trigger Channels

| Channel | Strength | Weakness | Best Practice |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Push notifications | Immediate, attention-grabbing | Easily disabled, annoying | Use sparingly, high value |
| Email | Rich content, permanent | Low open rates, spam filters | Personalize, segment |
| SMS | High open rates | Invasive, expensive | Only critical updates |
| In-app badges | Subtle, non-interruptive | Easy to ignore | Use for accumulated value |
| Browser notifications | Desktop access | High decline rate | Ask after value shown |

### External Trigger Audit

For each external trigger you send, verify:

- [ ] Does it clearly indicate what action to take?
- [ ] Is it connected to the user's internal trigger?
- [ ] Would I appreciate receiving this?
- [ ] Does it lead to a reward?
- [ ] Does it come at an appropriate time?
- [ ] Is the frequency sustainable?

## Internal Triggers

Internal triggers are cues from within the user—emotions, routines, situations, or places.

### The Goal

Move users from external triggers (you remind them) to internal triggers (they remind themselves).

```
External Trigger → Repeated Use → Association → Internal Trigger
```

### Common Internal Triggers

| Emotion/State | What User Wants | Product Examples |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Boredom** | Entertainment, stimulation | TikTok, Instagram, Games |
| **Loneliness** | Connection, belonging | Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord |
| **Uncertainty** | Information, reassurance | Google, Reddit, News apps |
| **FOMO** | To not miss out | Twitter, Slack, Instagram |
| **Stress** | Relief, escape | Games, Meditation apps |
| **Confusion** | Clarity, answers | Stack Overflow, Documentation |
| **Seeking validation** | Approval, recognition | Social media, Review platforms |
| **Incompleteness** | Closure, progress | To-do apps, Duolingo |

### Finding Your User's Internal Trigger

**The "5 Whys" Method:**

1. Why would someone use this product?
   → "To find recipes"

2. Why do they want to find recipes?
   → "To cook dinner"

3. Why do they need help cooking dinner?
   → "They don't know what to make"

4. Why don't they know what to make?
   → "They're bored of their usual meals"

5. Why is that a problem?
   → **"They feel stuck and uninspired"** ← Internal trigger

### Building Internal Trigger Associations

**1. Consistent pairing**
Every time user feels [emotion], they use product.
Repetition creates automatic association.

**2. Immediate relief**
Product must quickly address the emotional need.
Delays weaken the association.

**3. Frequency**
Daily use builds stronger associations than weekly.
If usage is naturally infrequent, strengthen external triggers.

**4. Context**
Same situation + same emotion = trigger.
Morning coffee + boredom = check news app.

### Internal Trigger Discovery Questions

Ask users (or observe):

- What were you doing right before you opened the app?
- What prompted you to check it?
- How were you feeling?
- What would you have done if the app didn't exist?
- When during the day do you typically use it?
- What situation makes you reach for it?

## Transitioning Users to Internal Triggers

### Stage 1: External Trigger Dependency
- User relies on notifications/reminders
- Without prompt, doesn't think of product
- **Action:** Consistent, valuable external triggers

### Stage 2: Forming Association
- User begins to associate product with emotion
- Still needs occasional external prompts
- **Action:** Reinforce emotional connection in product

### Stage 3: Internal Trigger Established
- User thinks of product automatically when emotion arises
- External triggers become reminders, not initiators
- **Action:** Reduce external triggers, focus on deepening habit

### Progression Metrics

| Stage | Indicator | Metric |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Trigger-dependent | High CTR on notifications, low organic opens |
| 2 | Forming habit | Growing organic sessions, declining need for prompts |
| 3 | Habitual | Consistent usage without triggers, quick return |

## Common Trigger Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Too many notifications | User disables or uninstalls | Quality over quantity |
| Generic triggers | No emotional connection | Personalize to user state |
| Wrong timing | Interrupts, annoys | Send when relevant to emotion |
| Unclear action | User doesn't know what to do | Specific, actionable message |
| No internal trigger strategy | Forever dependent on reminders | Build emotional associations |
| Ignoring opt-outs | Damages trust | Respect preferences immediately |
