# Guides

**Purpose:** System documentation and conventions that explain how Dex works and how to use it effectively.

## What Goes Here

Documentation files that:
- Explain system conventions and patterns
- Define standards for file organization
- Describe best practices for using Dex
- Document architectural decisions

## When to Use

Create a guide when:
- **System-wide pattern** - Convention applies across multiple features
- **Reference needed** - Users or Claude need to look up standards
- **Onboarding material** - New users need to understand core concepts
- **Architecture docs** - Explaining how major components work together

## Structure

Guides should be:
- **Reference-focused** - Describe what exists, not what to do
- **Evergreen** - Updated as system evolves
- **Scannable** - Use clear headings and examples
- **Linked** - Referenced from CLAUDE.md or flows

## Examples

Future guides might include:
- Task management patterns
- Person page best practices
- Project tracking conventions
- Meeting note structure
