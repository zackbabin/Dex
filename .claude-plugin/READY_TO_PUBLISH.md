## What You Need to Do 🔨

### Critical (Before Publishing)

1. **Test the Plugin Locally**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dave/Claudesidian/dex-core

   # Validate the plugin manifest
   claude plugin validate .

   # Link it locally to test
   claude plugin add . --scope user

   # Check it's installed
   claude plugin list

   # Test in a clean directory
   cd /tmp
   mkdir test-dex-vault
   cd test-dex-vault

   # Open Claude Code and try:
   # - /setup (or ask to run onboarding)
   # - /daily-plan
   # - /dex-level-up
   ```

2. **Fix the GitHub Repository URL**

   Update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:
   ```json
   "repository": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex"
   ```

   Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Create Python Requirements File**

   Create `dex-core/requirements.txt`:
   ```
   anthropic-mcp>=0.1.0
   pyyaml>=6.0
   python-dateutil>=2.8.0
   ```

4. **Create Example Configuration Files**

   These should exist but verify:
   - `System/user-profile.example.yaml`
   - `System/pillars.example.yaml`

   If they don't exist, copy from your actual files and remove personal data.

5. **Update Main README.md**

   Add a clear "Installation" section at the top:
   ```markdown
   ## Installation

   ```bash
   # Install Dex as a Claude Code plugin
   claude plugin install https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex

   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install anthropic-mcp pyyaml python-dateutil

   # Run onboarding
   # Open Claude Code in your vault directory and type: /setup
   ```

   See `.claude-plugin/INSTALLATION_QUICK_START.md` for detailed guide.
   ```

### Important (For Good UX)

6. **Create a Demo Video** (5-10 minutes)
   - Show installation process
   - Run through onboarding
   - Demonstrate key skills (/daily-plan, /meeting-prep)
   - Upload to YouTube
   - Add link to README.md

7. **Test Installation on Clean Machine**
   - Use a friend's computer or VM
   - Follow your installation docs exactly
   - Document any issues you encounter
   - Fix documentation gaps

8. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dave/Claudesidian/dex-core

   # Initialize if not already done
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial plugin release"

   # Create repository on GitHub (via web interface)
   # Then push:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

   # Create a release tag
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First public release"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

9. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Go to GitHub → Releases → "Create a new release"
   - Tag: v1.0.0
   - Title: "Dex 1.0 - Your AI Chief of Staff"
   - Description: Copy from your main README intro
   - Attach: Installation quick start guide
   - Mark as "Latest release"

### Optional (But Valuable)

10. **Create Your Own Marketplace**

    ```bash
    # In a separate directory
    mkdir dex-marketplace
    cd dex-marketplace
    mkdir -p .claude-plugin plugins

    # Create marketplace.json
    cat > .claude-plugin/marketplace.json << 'EOF'
    {
      "name": "dex-marketplace",
      "description": "Personal knowledge management and AI Chief of Staff tools",
      "owner": {
        "name": "Dave Killeen",
        "email": "dave@davekilleen.com"
      },
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name": "dex",
          "description": "Your AI Chief of Staff. Complete personal operating system.",
          "source": {
            "source": "url",
            "url": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex.git"
          },
          "category": "productivity",
          "homepage": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex"
        }
      ]
    }
    EOF

    # Push to GitHub
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Dex marketplace"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex-marketplace.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    Users can then:
    ```bash
    claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex-marketplace
    claude plugin install dex@dex-marketplace
    ```

11. **Submit to Official Marketplace**
    - Fork: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-public
    - Add your plugin entry to `marketplace.json`
    - Submit PR
    - Wait for Anthropic review
