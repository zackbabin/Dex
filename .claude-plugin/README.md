## Key Decisions You Need to Make

Before publishing:

1. **GitHub Username**
   - Update `plugin.json` with your actual GitHub URL
   - Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your real username

2. **Support Strategy**
   - How will you handle questions? (GitHub Issues recommended)
   - What's your response time commitment?

3. **Distribution Method**
   - Start with GitHub direct? (recommended)
   - Create your own marketplace? (better long-term)
   - Submit to official marketplace? (for scale)

4. **Revenue Model**
   - Keep completely free?
   - Add premium features later?
   - Offer consulting services?

## Critical Files to Update

Before publishing, ensure:

1. **plugin.json**
   - Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username
   - Verify all MCP server paths are correct

2. **README.md** (root level)
   - Add clear "Installation" section at the top
   - Link to `INSTALLATION_QUICK_START.md`

3. **.gitignore**
   - Verify it's blocking personal vault data
   - Test by running: `git status` (should not show vault folders)

4. **requirements.txt**
   - Already created ✅
   - Lists Python dependencies for users

- [ ] Install locally (works without errors)
- [ ] Test onboarding in fresh directory
- [ ] Verify MCP servers start successfully
