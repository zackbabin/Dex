# Dex Plugin Distribution Guide

This guide explains how to distribute Dex as a Claude Code plugin.

## Current Status

✅ **Plugin manifest created** - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
✅ **Plugin README created** - `.claude-plugin/PLUGIN_README.md`
✅ **Core components organized** - Skills, MCP servers, hooks all in `.claude/`
✅ **Python MCP servers functional** - `core/mcp/` directory with all servers
✅ **Documentation complete** - Comprehensive guides in `06-Resources/Dex_System/`

## Distribution Options

### Option 1: GitHub Direct Installation (Easiest - Recommended First)

**How it works:**
Users install directly from your GitHub repository:

```bash
claude plugin install https://github.com/davekilleen/dex
```

**What you need to do:**

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dave/Claudesidian/dex-core
   git remote add origin https://github.com/davekilleen/dex.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Test the installation**
   ```bash
   # In a test directory
   claude plugin install https://github.com/davekilleen/dex
   ```

3. **Document the installation** - Users need:
   - Python 3.10+
   - `pip install anthropic-mcp pyyaml python-dateutil`
   - Run `/setup` after installation

**Pros:**
- Simple to set up
- You control updates
- Users get latest version directly
- No marketplace approval needed

**Cons:**
- Users need to know the GitHub URL
- No centralized discovery
- Manual URL sharing

### Option 2: Submit to Official Claude Code Marketplace

**How it works:**
Anthropic maintains an official marketplace at `claude-plugins-official`. You submit a PR to add Dex.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Prepare your plugin**
   - Ensure all files are ready (done ✅)
   - Create comprehensive tests
   - Validate plugin manifest: `claude plugin validate dex-core/`

2. **Fork and clone the official marketplace**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-public.git
   cd claude-plugins-public
   ```

3. **Add your plugin**
   ```bash
   # Copy your plugin to the marketplace
   cp -r /path/to/dex-core ./plugins/dex

   # Or add as external plugin (just metadata)
   # Edit marketplace.json to add your entry
   ```

4. **Submit PR** to `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-public`

5. **Wait for review** - Anthropic team reviews and approves

**Pros:**
- Official distribution
- Discoverable by all Claude Code users
- Trusted source
- Automatic updates

**Cons:**
- Requires approval from Anthropic
- May have submission guidelines
- Slower update cycle

### Option 3: Create Your Own Marketplace (Best for Distribution)

**How it works:**
You create a marketplace that users can add to Claude Code, similar to `every-marketplace`.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Create a marketplace repository**
   ```bash
   mkdir dex-marketplace
   cd dex-marketplace
   mkdir -p .claude-plugin plugins/dex
   ```

2. **Create marketplace manifest** - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "dex-marketplace",
     "description": "Personal knowledge management and AI Chief of Staff tools",
     "owner": {
       "name": "Dave Killeen",
       "email": "dave@davekilleen.com"
     },
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "dex",
         "description": "Your AI Chief of Staff. Personal operating system with strategic work management, meeting intelligence, relationship tracking, and daily planning.",
         "source": "./plugins/dex",
         "category": "productivity",
         "version": "1.0.0",
         "author": {
           "name": "Dave Killeen",
           "email": "dave@davekilleen.com"
         },
         "homepage": "https://github.com/davekilleen/dex"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Copy Dex into the marketplace**
   ```bash
   cp -r /Users/dave/Claudesidian/dex-core ./plugins/dex
   ```

4. **Publish to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial marketplace setup"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/davekilleen/dex-marketplace.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Users install your marketplace**
   ```bash
   # Add the marketplace
   claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/davekilleen/dex-marketplace

   # Install Dex from your marketplace
   claude plugin install dex@dex-marketplace
   ```

**Pros:**
- You control everything
- Can add other plugins later
- Fast updates (no approval needed)
- Professional distribution
- Build a brand around your tools

**Cons:**
- Requires maintaining a marketplace
- Users need to add marketplace first
- Extra setup step for users

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended Strategy)

**Best of all worlds:**

1. **Start with GitHub direct** (Option 1)
   - Quick to test
   - Early adopters can install immediately
   - Get feedback fast

2. **Create your own marketplace** (Option 3)
   - Professional distribution
   - Easy for users: one command to add marketplace
   - You control updates
   - Can add complementary plugins later (Dex Premium features, integrations, etc.)

3. **Submit to official marketplace** (Option 2) - Later
   - Once proven stable
   - Wider discovery
   - Trusted distribution

## Testing Your Plugin

Before distributing, test thoroughly:

### 1. Validate the Plugin Manifest

```bash
cd /Users/dave/Claudesidian/dex-core
claude plugin validate .
```

This checks:
- `plugin.json` is valid JSON
- Required fields are present
- MCP server configurations are correct
- Skills follow conventions

### 2. Test Local Installation

```bash
# Link locally for testing
claude plugin add /Users/dave/Claudesidian/dex-core --scope user

# Check it's installed
claude plugin list

# Try a skill
cd /tmp
mkdir test-vault
cd test-vault
# Run: /setup or /daily-plan
```

### 3. Test Clean Installation

```bash
# Remove local installation
claude plugin remove dex

# Install from GitHub (after you've pushed)
claude plugin install https://github.com/davekilleen/dex

# Run onboarding
# Navigate to test directory
# Run: /setup
```

### 4. Test MCP Servers

After installation, verify MCP servers start:

```bash
# Check MCP server logs
# Look in ~/.claude/logs/mcp-servers/
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/mcp-servers/work.log
```

System/Session_Memory/
System/.onboarding/state.json
System/user-profile.yaml
System/pillars.yaml

# Python

*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
venv/
env/

# Environment
.env

```

## Example Installation Flow for Users

Document this clearly in your main README:

```bash
# 1. Install the plugin
claude plugin install https://github.com/davekilleen/dex
