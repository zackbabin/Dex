## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-16

### 📊 Analytics Actually Works Now — Plus Automatic Coverage for Future Features

**Before:** Dex had analytics code scattered across skills, but most of it was gated behind a "beta feature" flag that nobody activated. Even if you opted in to anonymous usage tracking, most events never fired — the SSL certificate handling was broken, the visitor ID was random instead of stable, and the consent check had an unnecessary beta gate layered on top. Result: zero meaningful data reaching Pendo, making it impossible to know which features users actually find valuable.

**Now:** The entire analytics pipeline has been rebuilt:

- Removed the beta gate — analytics now fires based purely on your opt-in consent (as it always should have)
- Fixed SSL and visitor ID stability so events actually reach Pendo
- All 30 skills now have `track_event` wired in (previously only 8 had it, and those were broken)
- All 6 MCP servers fire events on key actions (task created, meeting viewed, idea captured, etc.)
- New analytics MCP server ships with Dex and auto-configures during `/dex-update`
- `/dex-push` now has a mandatory Analytics Coverage Gate — every future push checks for missing analytics before committing
- Consent prompt now appears at session start (not just during skills) and persists until you decide — ignore it and it asks again next time, say "no thanks" and it's gone forever
- `usage_log.md` automatically gets new feature entries during `/dex-update` without losing your existing checkboxes

**Result:** If you've opted in, your usage data now actually helps improve Dex. And the coverage gate ensures this doesn't break again as new features ship.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-16

### ✨ Smoother Onboarding — Clickable Choices & Cross-Platform Support

**Before:** During setup, picking your role meant scrolling through a wall of 31 numbered options and typing a number. If your Mac's Calendar app was running in the background (but not in the foreground), Dex couldn't detect your calendars — silently skipping calendar optimization. And if you onboarded in Cursor vs Claude Code, the question prompts might not work because each platform has a different tool for presenting clickable options.

**Now:** Role selection, company size, and other choices are presented as clickable lists — just pick from the menu. Dex detects your platform once at the start (Cursor vs Claude Code vs terminal) and uses the right question tool throughout. Calendar detection works regardless of whether Calendar.app is in the foreground or background. QA testing uses dry-run mode so nothing gets overwritten.

**Result:** Onboarding feels polished — fewer things to type, fewer silent failures, works correctly whether you're in Cursor or Claude Code.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-16

### 🔧 Fixed: "Evolve Itself" Was Broken — Now It Actually Works

**Before:** Dex promised to "suggest improvements based on usage patterns" and "monitor Claude Code releases daily." The monitoring worked — `/dex-whats-new` would scan the changelog and show you new features. But it stopped there. Nothing was written to your improvement backlog. Your `System/Dex_Backlog.md` said "AI-ranked improvement backlog (ideas from you + AI discoveries)" — but the "AI discoveries" section was always empty. The system detected signals but never connected them to actual improvement ideas.

**Now:** The pipeline is connected end-to-end:

- `/dex-whats-new` scans Claude Code releases AND automatically creates or enriches backlog ideas — not just shows you what's new and moves on
- `/daily-plan` surfaces the most timely idea as an "Innovation Spotlight" when there's fresh evidence (e.g., "Claude just shipped native memory — this changes how we'd build idea-006")
- `/daily-review` connects today's frustrations to existing improvement ideas in your backlog
- `/week-review` shows your top 3 highest-scored ideas
- Say "I wish Dex could..." in conversation and it's captured to your backlog automatically — deduplicated against what's already there

**Result:** The self-improving system that was promised now actually works. Your backlog fills itself with AI-discovered ideas, enriches them as new evidence arrives, and surfaces the right ones at the right time — during your existing planning and review rituals.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-15

### 🔧 Fixed: Granola Meeting Notes Recovery

**Before:** Some Granola meetings appeared to have no notes in Dex — they'd get skipped during processing, wouldn't show up in search, and were invisible to meeting intelligence. This happened most often with meetings recorded on mobile or where you'd edited notes using Granola's built-in editor (which stores notes in a different internal format than plain text).

**Now:** Dex automatically detects when Granola has stored your notes in this alternative format and converts them so they work everywhere — meeting sync, search, and meeting prep.

**Result:** No more "missing" meetings. If Granola has your notes, Dex will find them.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-15

### 🔧 Fixed: Dex Now Always Knows What Day It Is

**Before:** Dex relied entirely on the host platform (Cursor, Claude Code) to tell Claude the current date. If the platform didn't surface it prominently, Claude could lose track of what day it was — especially frustrating during daily planning or scheduling conversations.

**Now:** The session-start hook explicitly outputs today's date at the very top of every session context injection, so it's front-and-center regardless of platform behavior.

**Result:** No more "what day is it?" confusion. Dex always knows the date, every session, every platform.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-05

### 🎯 Smart Pillar Inference for Task Creation

**What was frustrating:** Every time you asked to create a task ("Remind me to prep for the Acme demo"), Dex would stop and ask: "Which pillar is this for?" This added friction to quick captures and broke your flow.

**What's different now:** Dex analyzes your request and infers the most likely pillar based on keywords:
- "Prep demo for Acme Corp" → **Deal Support** (demo + customer keywords)
- "Write blog post about AI" → **Thought Leadership** (content keywords)
- "Review beta feedback" → **Product Feedback** (feedback keywords)

Then confirms with a quick one-liner:
> "Creating under Product Feedback pillar (looks like data gathering). Sound right, or should it be Deal Support / Thought Leadership?"

**Why you'll care:** Fast task capture with data quality. No more back-and-forth just to add a reminder. But your tasks still have proper strategic alignment.

**Customization options:** Want different behavior? You can customize this in your CLAUDE.md:
- **Less strict:** Remove the pillar requirement entirely and use a default pillar
- **Triage flow:** Route quick captures to `00-Inbox/Quick_Captures.md`, then sort them during `/triage` (skill you can build yourself or request)
- **Your own keywords:** Edit `System/pillars.yaml` to add custom keywords for better inference

**Technical:** Updated task creation behavior in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to include pillar inference logic. The work-mcp validation still requires a pillar (maintains data integrity), but Dex now handles the inference and confirmation before calling the MCP.

### ⚡ Performance: Calendar Queries 30x Faster (30s → <1s)

**What was frustrating:** Calendar queries took 30 seconds to respond. You'd ask "what meetings do I have?" and wait... and wait... Eventually you'd stop asking.

**What was broken:** The calendar MCP used AppleScript to query Calendar.app. AppleScript's `every event of calendar` loads ALL events (years of history) into memory, then filters client-side. For a work calendar with thousands of events, this was painfully slow. Plus, recurring events returned all historical instances, causing ghost events from weeks ago to appear in today's results.

**What's fixed:** 
- Replaced AppleScript with **native EventKit** (Apple's calendar framework)
- EventKit uses proper database queries, not linear scans
- Returns only events in the exact date range requested
- **Performance:** 30 seconds → under 1 second (30x faster!)
- **Accuracy:** No more ghost events from the past

**One-time setup:** After updating, run `/calendar-setup` to grant Python access to Calendar. This is a macOS permission that unlocks fast queries. If you skip this, calendar queries will still work (using AppleScript fallback) but will be slower.

**Technical:** Created `calendar_eventkit.py` using PyObjC bindings for EventKit. Updated `calendar_server.py` to use EventKit for all calendar operations (list, search, get_events, next_event, attendees). Added `pyobjc-framework-EventKit` to install script dependencies. Created `/calendar-setup` skill to guide permission granting.

**How to update:** 
1. In Cursor, type `/dex-update`
2. Run `/calendar-setup` to enable fast queries
3. Done!

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Hardcoded Paths (Thank You Community!)

**What was broken:** Several scripts and features contained paths hardcoded to my machine (`/Users/dave/...`). 🙈 

**What this affected:**
- `/dex-obsidian-setup` — Obsidian integration wouldn't work
- Background automation scripts (changelog checker, learning review) — wouldn't run
- Two internal scripts (`migrate-commands-to-skills.sh`, `fix-duplicate-frontmatter.sh`) — confusingly visible in repo

**Core functionality was fine:** Your daily workflows (`/daily-plan`, `/review`, task management, meeting processing) all worked normally. This bug only affected specific features.

**What's fixed:** 
- All paths now use dynamic resolution — they work on any machine, any folder name
- Removed internal development scripts that shouldn't have been distributed
- LaunchAgent setup now properly substitutes your vault path

**How to update:** In Cursor, just type `/dex-update` — that's it!

**Thank you** to the community members who reported these issues. Turns out I should test on machines that aren't mine. 😅 Your feedback makes Dex better for everyone.

### 🔬 X-Ray Vision: Learn AI by Seeing What Just Happened

**What was frustrating:** Dex felt like a black box. You knew it was helping, but you had no idea what was actually happening — which tools were firing, how context was loaded, or how you could customize the system. Learning AI concepts felt abstract and disconnected from your actual experience.

**What's new:** Run `/xray` anytime to understand what just happened in your conversation.

**Default mode (just `/xray`):** Shows the work from THIS conversation:
- What files were read and why
- What tools/MCPs were used
- What context was loaded at session start (and how)
- How each action connects to underlying AI concepts

**Deep-dive modes:**
- `/xray ai` — First principles: context windows, tokens, statelessness, tools
- `/xray dex` — The architecture: CLAUDE.md, hooks, MCPs, skills, vault structure
- `/xray boot` — The session startup sequence in detail
- `/xray today` — ScreenPipe-powered analysis of your day
- `/xray extend` — How to customize: edit CLAUDE.md, create skills, write hooks, build MCPs

**The philosophy:** The best way to learn AI is by examining what just happened, not reading abstract explanations. Every `/xray` session connects specific actions (I read this file because...) to general concepts (...CLAUDE.md tells me where files live).

**Where you'll see it:**
- Run `/xray` after any conversation to see "behind the scenes"
- Educational concepts are tied to YOUR vault and YOUR actions
- End with practical customization opportunities

**The goal:** You're not just a user — you're empowered to extend and personalize your AI system because you understand the underlying mechanics.

### 🔌 Productivity Stack Integrations (Notion, Slack, Google Workspace)

**What was frustrating:** Your work context is scattered across Notion, Slack, and Gmail. When prepping for meetings, you manually search each tool. When looking up a person, you don't see your communication history with them.

**What's new:** Connect your productivity tools to Dex for richer context everywhere:

1. **Notion Integration** (`/integrate-notion`)
   - Search your Notion workspace from Dex
   - Meeting prep pulls relevant Notion docs
   - Person pages link to shared Notion content
   - Uses official Notion MCP (`@notionhq/notion-mcp-server`)

2. **Slack Integration** (`/integrate-slack`)
   - "What did Sarah say about the Q1 budget?" → Searches Slack
   - Meeting prep includes recent Slack context with attendees
   - Person pages show communication history
   - Easy cookie auth (no bot setup required) or traditional bot tokens

3. **Google Workspace Integration** (`/integrate-google`)
   - Gmail thread context in person pages
   - Email threads with meeting attendees during prep
   - Calendar event enrichment
   - One-time OAuth setup (~5 min)

**Where you'll see it:**
- `/meeting-prep` — Pulls context from all enabled integrations
- Person pages — Integration Context section with Slack/Notion/Email history
- New users — Onboarding Step 9 offers integration setup
- Existing users — `/dex-update` announces new integrations, detects your existing MCPs

**Smart detection for existing users:**
If you already have Notion/Slack/Google MCPs configured, Dex detects them and offers to:
- Keep your existing setup (it works!)
- Upgrade to Dex recommended packages (better maintained, more features)
- Skip and configure later

**Setup commands:**
- `/integrate-notion` — 2 min setup (just needs a token)
- `/integrate-slack` — 3 min setup (cookie auth or bot token)
- `/integrate-google` — 5 min setup (OAuth through Google Cloud)

---

### 🔔 Ambient Commitment Detection (ScreenPipe Integration) [BETA]

**What was frustrating:** You say "I'll send that over" in Slack or get asked "Can you review this?" in email. These micro-commitments don't become tasks — they fall through the cracks until someone follows up (awkward) or they're forgotten (worse).

**What's new:** Dex now detects uncommitted asks and promises from your screen activity:

1. **Commitment Detection** — Scans apps like Slack, Email, Teams for commitment patterns
   - Inbound asks: "Can you review...", "Need your input...", "@you"
   - Outbound promises: "I'll send...", "Let me follow up...", "Sure, I'll..."
   - Deadline extraction: "by Friday", "by EOD", "ASAP", "tomorrow"

2. **Smart Matching** — Connects commitments to your existing context
   - Matches people mentioned to your People pages
   - Matches topics to your Projects
   - Matches keywords to your Goals

3. **Review Integration** — Surfaces during your rituals
   - `/daily-review` shows today's uncommitted items
   - `/week-review` shows commitment health stats
   - `/commitment-scan` for standalone scanning anytime

**Example during daily review:**
```
🔔 Uncommitted Items Detected

1. Sarah Chen (Slack, 2:34 PM)
   > "Can you review the pricing proposal by Friday?"
   📎 Matches: Q1 Pricing Project
   → [Create task] [Already handled] [Ignore]
```

**Privacy-first:**
- Requires ScreenPipe running locally (all data stays on your machine)
- Sensitive apps excluded by default (1Password, banking, etc.)
- You decide what becomes a task — nothing auto-created

**Beta activation required:**
- Run `/beta-activate DEXSCREENPIPE2026` to unlock ScreenPipe features
- Then asked once during `/daily-plan` or `/daily-review` to enable
- Must explicitly enable before any screen data is accessed
- New users can also run `/screenpipe-setup` after beta activation

**New skills:**
- `/commitment-scan` — Scan for uncommitted items anytime
- `/screenpipe-setup` — Enable/disable ScreenPipe with privacy configuration

**Why you'll care:** Never forget a promise or miss an ask again. The things you commit to in chat apps now surface in your task system automatically.

**Requirements:** ScreenPipe must be installed and opted-in. See `06-Resources/Dex_System/ScreenPipe_Setup.md` for setup.

### 🤖 AI Model Flexibility: Budget Cloud & Offline Mode

**What was frustrating:** Dex only worked with Claude, which costs money and requires internet. Heavy users faced high API bills, and travelers couldn't use Dex on planes or trains.

**What's new:** Two new ways to use Dex:

1. **Budget Cloud Mode** — Use cheaper AI models like Kimi K2.5 or DeepSeek when online
   - Save 80-97% on API costs for routine tasks
   - Requires ~$5-10 upfront via OpenRouter
   - Quality is great for daily tasks (summaries, planning, task management)

2. **Offline Mode** — Download an AI to run locally on your computer
   - Works on planes, trains, anywhere without internet
   - Completely free forever
   - Requires 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended)

3. **Smart Routing** — Let Dex automatically pick the best model
   - Claude for complex tasks
   - Budget models for simple tasks
   - Local model when offline

**New skills:**
- `/ai-setup` — Guided setup for budget cloud and offline mode
- `/ai-status` — Check your AI configuration and credits

**Why you'll care:** Reduce your AI costs by 80%+ for everyday tasks, or work completely offline during travel — your choice.

**User-friendly:** The setup is fully guided with plain-language explanations. Dex handles the technical parts (starting services, downloading models) automatically.

### 📊 Help Dave Improve Dex (Optional Analytics)

**What's this about?**

Dave could use your help making Dex better. This release adds optional, privacy-first analytics that lets you share which Dex features you use — not what you do with them, just that you used them.

**What gets tracked (if you opt in):**
- Which Dex built-in features you use (e.g., "ran /daily-plan")
- Nothing about what you DO with features
- No content, names, notes, or conversations — ever

**What's NOT tracked:**
- Custom skills or MCPs you create
- Any content you write or manage
- Who you meet with or what you discuss

**The ask:**

During onboarding (new users) or your next planning session (existing users), Dex will ask once:

> "Dave could use your help improving Dex. Help improve Dex? [Yes, happy to help] / [No thanks]"

Say yes, and you help Dave understand which features work and which need improvement. Say no, and nothing changes — Dex works exactly the same.

**Technical:**
- Added `analytics_helper.py` in `core/mcp/`
- Consent tracked in `System/usage_log.md`
- Events only fire if `analytics.enabled: true` in user-profile.yaml
- 20+ skills now have analytics hooks

**Beta only:** This feature is currently in beta testing.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-03

### 🧠 Planning Intelligence: Your System Now Thinks Ahead

**What's this about?**

Until now, daily and weekly planning showed you information — your tasks, calendar, priorities. But you had to connect the dots yourself. 

Now Dex actively thinks ahead and surfaces things you might have missed.

This is the biggest upgrade to Dex's intelligence since launch. Based on feedback from early users, we've rebuilt the planning skills to be proactive rather than passive. Dex now does the mental work of connecting your calendar to your tasks, tracking your commitments, and warning you when things are slipping — so you can focus on actually doing the work.

---

**Midweek Awareness**

**Before:** You'd set weekly priorities on Monday, then forget about them until Friday's review. By then it's too late — Priority 3 never got touched.

**Now:** When you run `/daily-plan` midweek, Dex knows where you stand:

> "It's Wednesday. You've completed 1 of 3 weekly priorities. Priority 2 is in progress (2 of 5 tasks done). Priority 3 hasn't been touched yet — you have 2 days left."

**Result:** Course-correct while there's still time. No more end-of-week surprises.

---

**Meeting Intelligence**

**Before:** You'd see "Acme call" on your calendar and have to manually check: what's the status of that project? Any outstanding tasks? What did we discuss last time?

**Now:** For each meeting, Dex automatically connects the dots:

> "You have the Acme call Thursday. Looking at that project: the proposal is still in draft, and you owe Sarah the pricing section. Want to block time for prep?"

**Result:** Walk into every meeting prepared. Related tasks and project status surface automatically.

---

**Commitment Tracking**

**Before:** You'd say "I'll get back to you Wednesday" in a meeting, write it in your notes... and forget. It lived in a meeting note you never looked at again.

**Now:** Dex scans your meeting notes for things you said you'd do:

> "You told Mike you'd get back to him by Wednesday. That's today."

**Result:** Keep your promises. Nothing slips through because it was buried in notes.

---

**Smart Scheduling**

**Before:** All tasks were equal. A 3-hour strategy doc and a 5-minute email sat on the same list with no guidance on when to tackle them.

**Now:** Dex classifies tasks by effort and matches them to your calendar:

> "You have a 3-hour block Wednesday morning — perfect for 'Write Q1 strategy doc' (deep work). Thursday is stacked with meetings — good for quick tasks only."

It even warns you when you have more deep work than available focus time.

**Result:** Stop fighting your calendar. Know which tasks fit which days.

---

**Intelligent Priority Suggestions**

**Before:** `/week-plan` asked "What are your priorities?" and waited. You had to figure it out yourself.

**Now:** Dex suggests priorities based on your goals, task backlog, and calendar shape:

> "Based on your goals, tasks, and calendar, I suggest:
> 1. Complete pricing proposal — Goal 1 needs this for milestone 3
> 2. Customer interviews — Goal 2 hasn't had activity in 3 weeks
> 3. Follow up on Acme — You committed to Sarah by Friday"

You still decide. But now you have a thinking partner who's done the analysis.

**Result:** Start each week with intelligent suggestions, not a blank page.

---

**Concrete Progress (Not Fake Percentages)**

**Before:** "Goal X is at 55%." What does that even mean? Percentages feel precise but communicate nothing.

**Now:** "Goal X: 3 of 5 milestones complete. This week you finished the pricing page and scheduled the customer interviews."

**Result:** Weekly reviews that actually show what you accomplished and what's left.

---

**How it works (under the hood):**

Six new capabilities power the intelligence:

| What Dex can now do | Why it matters |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Check your week's progress | Knows which priorities are on track vs slipping |
| Understand meeting context | Connects each meeting to related projects and people |
| Find your commitments | Scans notes for promises you made and when they're due |
| Judge task effort | Knows a strategy doc needs focus time, an email doesn't |
| Read your calendar shape | Sees which days have deep work time vs meeting chaos |
| Match tasks to time | Suggests what to work on based on available blocks |

**What to try:**

- Run `/daily-plan` on a Wednesday — see midweek awareness in action
- Check `/week-plan` — get intelligent priority suggestions instead of a blank page
- Before a big meeting, run `/meeting-prep` — watch it pull together everything relevant

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-03

### 🎉 Personalize Dex Without Losing Your Changes

**What's this about?**

Many of you have been making Dex your own — adding personal instructions, connecting your own tools like Gmail or Notion, tweaking how things work. That's exactly what Dex is designed for.

But until now, there was a tension: when I release updates to Dex with new features and improvements, your personal changes could get overwritten. Some people avoided updating to protect their setup. Others updated and had to redo their customizations.

This release fixes that. Your personalizations and my updates now work together.

---

**What stays protected:**

**Your personal instructions**

If you've added notes to yourself in the CLAUDE.md file — reminders about how you like things done, specific workflows, preferences — those are now protected. Put them between the clearly marked `USER_EXTENSIONS` section, and they'll never be touched by updates.

**Your connected tools**

If you've connected Dex to other apps (like your email, calendar, or note-taking tools), those connections are now protected too. When you add a tool, Dex automatically names it in a way that keeps it safe from updates.

**New command: `/dex-add-mcp`** — When you want to connect a new tool, just run this command. It handles the technical bits and makes sure your connection is protected. No config files to edit.

---

**What happens when there's a conflict?**

Sometimes my updates will change a file that you've also changed. When that happens, Dex now guides you through it with simple choices:

- **"Keep my version"** — Your changes stay, skip this part of the update
- **"Use the new version"** — Take the update, replace your changes
- **"Keep both"** — Dex will keep both versions so nothing is lost

No technical knowledge needed. Dex explains what changed and why, then you decide.

---

**Why this matters**

I want you to make Dex truly yours. And I want to keep improving it with new features you'll find useful. Now both can happen. Update whenever you like, knowing your personal setup is safe.

---

### 🔄 Background Meeting Sync (Granola Users)

**Before:** To get your Granola meetings into Dex, you had to manually run `/process-meetings`. Each time, you'd wait for it to process, then continue your work. Easy to forget, tedious when you remembered.

**Now:** A background job syncs your meetings from Granola every 30 minutes automatically. One-time setup, then it just runs.

**To enable:** Run `.scripts/meeting-intel/install-automation.sh`

**Result:** Your meeting notes are always current. When you run `/daily-plan` or look up a person, their recent meetings are already there — no manual step needed.

---

### ✨ Prompt Improvement Works Everywhere

**Before:** The `/prompt-improver` command required extra configuration. In some setups, it just didn't work.

**Now:** It automatically uses whatever AI is available — no special configuration needed.

**Result:** Prompt improvement just works, regardless of your setup.

---

### 🚀 Easier First-Time Setup

**Before:** New users sometimes hit confusing error messages during setup, with no clear guidance on what to do next.

**Now:**
- Clear error messages explain exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
- Requirements are checked upfront with step-by-step instructions
- Fewer manual steps to get everything working

**Result:** New users get up and running faster with less frustration.

---
